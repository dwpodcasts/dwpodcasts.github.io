Can I use blockchain technology? Will artificial intelligence take
over my career? What exactly is "Machine Learning"? These are some of
the questions „SHIFT – Living in the Digital Age“ tries to answer. The
program focuses on a single topic – in depth and in detail. We talk to
experts, present the key facts and explain complicated subjects in a
simple manner. SHIFT – substantial, never superficial.
