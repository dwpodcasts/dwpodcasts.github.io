	Refugees hoping to make it across the English Channel often get stuck in Calais on France's northern coast. The entire port area is surrounded by high fences to keep them from making a dash for ferries bound for Britain.

	Ladislav Vana loves animals so much that he's turned his home into a private zoo and shelter. Some 100 animals of all kinds have lived here for years in spartan conditions. But two young lions are the last straw for his neighbors. They're up in arms and fear for their safety.

	Last year, 28 Bangladeshi strawberry pickers were shot and wounded by their foremen for demanding months of unpaid wages owed to them. The Greek courts acquitted the farmers who admitted to the shooting. Greek human rights activists say that racism against Asian migrant workers is to blame.

	While politicians argue about topics such as possession of Crimea, how to feed the people on the peninsula and what will happen to tourism, the football club hitherto known as FC Sevastopol has its own worries. The team used to play in the Ukrainian Premier League. Now under another name and with a changed squad, they've been incorporated into the third division of the Russian league. But the Ukrainian football federation is opposed to the move - as are the international associations FIFA and UEFA.

	France remains a hugely popular tourist destination. Hotel bookings are decreasing year by year, however, especially in the capital Paris. Service there doesn't exactly have the best reputation, while not speaking French can also be a major problem. That's set to change. Voluntary city guides called Paris Greeters accompany small groups of tourists, showing them local life in their own parts of town. At the same time, hotel and restaurant owners in particular are resisting the newly prescribed hospitality.

	In Sarcelles, a suburb of Paris, Jews and Muslims have traditionally lived peacefully side by side - shopping at the stores or playing soccer together. Now many Jewish families are concerned for their safety due to antagonism and threats from Muslim protesters, and have bought weapons for self-defense.

	The Ndrangheta is rich, powerful, and heavily involved with drug cartels all over the world. But the bosses can’t be seen in public. Instead, they hide out from the police in underground bunkers that are connected to ordinary houses. The region of Calabria is the hub of their international drug trafficking operation - and an excellent hideout. Shielded by a code of silence, the Mafia bosses live with the tacit protection of the local population.

	It's only three meters high and 30 kilometers long, but the new barbed wire fence along the Bulgarian-Turkish border reveals a lot about relations between the European Union and the oft-tumultuous neighboring regions. Sofia hopes the new barrier will prevent refugees, most of them Syrians fleeing from civil war, from entering the country. Those who do make it across the border often find themselves housed in Bulgarian refugee camps, which are known for their poor conditions.

	For many in the Netherlands, the repatriation of bodies of the victims is proceeding too slowly. They believe Moscow is responsible for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight. A number of parents of victims have demanded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ensure the bodies of their children are returned. Some are also calling for the deportation of Putin’s daughter, who lives in a luxury penthouse in Voorschoten, an affluent suburb of the Hague. There were 298 passengers on board flight MH17, among them 193 Dutch citizens.

	Vultures have long had a bad reputation in Spain. Time and time again, the birds are illegally poisoned, because they are said to prey on living cattle. Now the EU has authorized the administration of veterinary diclofenac to livestock in Spain and Italy - a deadly threat to the four species of vultures that live in Spain. The anti-inflammatory drug has already led to the near-extinction of the vulture population in India, Pakistan and Nepal. The birds ingest the substance when eating the carcasses of cattle treated with the drug, and die of kidney failure.

	Three volcanoes constantly keep Italy on tenterhooks: Stromboli, the most active; the unpredictable Vesuvius; and the tallest, Mount Etna. At a height of 3352 meters, it visibly dominates much of the eastern coast of Sicily. Time and again, earthquakes shake the region, clouds of ash darken the skies and lava flows destroy houses high up on the mountain. A team of volcanologists and rangers on site monitor every movement Etna makes. Theoretically, an eruption could happen at any time.

	Conservationists, however, argue that while hydropower does not produce greenhouse gases, too many dams could cause entire rivers to dry up in the summer. They point to the southern Carpathian Mountains, where about 500 hydroelectric power plants - some still being built - are located. The wild rapids at these sites are particularly lucrative for investors. At the same time, many of the projects are also located in conservation areas, and the damage to habitats is severe. Residents of the region are fighting to keep the remaining streams and rivers in Romania untouched.

	The surprising thing is that, while the entire family had to collect money to pay for her first artificial insemination, her second test tube baby is being funded by the government. Laws have been relaxed in Poland, a Catholic country where some priests refuse to baptize babies conceived through in vitro fertilization. Still, the method has been used in that country since 1987, and now the state is even helping defray the costs of the expensive reproductive procedure.

	The allegations are serious: there are indications of an organized campaign to covertly co-opt schools in England. An inquiry discovered that at several schools in Birmingham, girls and boys were segrated. At some schools, Arabic is a required subject, and Christian holidays are no longer observed. School trips are organized to Mecca and Medina. The conservative education minister, Michael Gove, has announced that with the coming school year, all state schools are required to teach "British values.” The schools under investigation have rejected the accusations.

	It's a world of its own, a world full of drugs, disease and poverty that's developed beneath the capital. The sewer dwellers live in the tunnels, canals, and sometimes in caves they've dug themselves, because they have nowhere else to go.

He says the key to his country's future is to give municipalities more authority.

	We usually associate aerial drones with surveillance and destruction. It's less well known that they can also save lives. Just such a deployment is being tried at present in the Fichtel Mountains. A team of electronic engineers is using a drone to search meadows and fields where deer are suspected. The device has two eyes in the form of one infrared and one color camera. The infrared camera locates the animals by detecting their body heat. The color camera then ascertains whether they actually are deer. So far, it's been a striking success.

                <dd>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 21:30:00 GMT | More than 14,000 children have disappeared in Turkey in the last five years alone. A special police unit has been formed to look for those still missing.
	The General Command of the Turkish Gendarmerie says human trafficking is involved in most cases, and that children are being kidnapped as laborers, child soldiers and even for the illegal organ trade. Although most have since been found, 834 children who disappeared within the last five years remain missing. Currently the police are looking for almost 1500 children.

                <dd>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 21:30:00 GMT | Authorities on the island of Mallorca have had enough of cheap mass tourism. They want to rid themselves of their rowdy drinking and partying clientele with new regulations.
	Tourists to Mallorca know the Playa de Palma in its capital as a place to party. The strip of beach a few minutes' drive east of Palma has declined over the years, largely due to its masses of mainly German and British binge-drinking visitors. The Spanish authorities are now trying to use new regulations to stem the excesses and give the island a new image.

	The Italian navy has five ships on permanent deployment patrolling the waters. Their mission is to rescue refugees and people in distress and bring them to safety. The refugees who get stranded in Italy are mainly from Syria and east Afridca, but they know they could be deported to their home countries at any time, so they often try to conceal their identities, hoping to stay in Europe.

	Denmark is among the countries to see major gains for right-wing euroskeptic parties. The Danish People’s Party (DF) won the largest share of the vote, beating the governing Social Democrats into second place. The results will give the party three of the country’s 13 seats in the European Parliament. The DF has, however, ruled out an alliance with anti-EU parties, citing the right-wing Front National in France as too extremist.

	These explosive relics from the Bosnian War of the 1990s, are creating extra dangers for rescue workers. Searching for landmines is painstaking work, however, and the floods have dispersed them over large areas. Rescue crews already have enough to deal with, as much of Serbia and Bosnia's infrastructure has been destroyed and there's a real risk of landslides.

	Most farmers in Romania are small-scale producers with a small patch of land. Their production methods are inefficient, and EU law caters to intensive farming, so family farms lose out. Now they also have to adhere to EU-wide hygiene standards, which are proving too expensive for many. As a result, some traditional foods -- including certain varieties of tomatoes and cheese -- could vanish from supermarket shelves.

	Until recently, the eastern city of Kharkiv was taking a back seat to the crisis-torn region of Donetsk. But Kharkiv has moved into the spotlight since it hosted the second in a series of round table talks. Our reporter paid a visit to the city to find out how residents view the upcoming presidential election. How is Petro Poroshenko - the billionaire industrialist who stands a good chance of winning - faring there? How is the election commission preparing for the vote and what’s the mood on the street?

	The two top candidates for the post of European Commission president are Jean-Claude Juncker from Luxemburg and Martin Schulz from Germany. As the campaign heats up, they head for France, a country that is grappling with many problems. Though it is Europe’s second largest economy, debt is rising, the far right is gaining in strength, and the government is lurching from one crisis to the next.

Now the internet expert from Sweden is campaigning for a second term in the European Parliament. Another young candidate is Nezika Pavlic from Slovenia.

	Fresh Start sees itself as a counterweight to the eurosceptic wing of the Tory party. The parliamentary group has about 100 members, among them Julian Smith from North Yorkshire. While Smith believes Europe needs reform, he staunchly defends Britain remaining in the EU. Smith has been facing criticism in his district, where the UK Independence Party has been gaining ground. But he enjoys support from industry and business.

	The leftist Syriza alliance is leading the polls for the upcoming European election in Greece. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras is also the Party of the European Left’s candidate for president of the European Commission. Tsipras opposes neoliberal policies at the EU level and favors greater social expenditures. At home in Greece, Alexis Tsipras and his party are also staking their claim.

	The Front National is hoping to capitalize on its recent success in municipal elections, when it won the mayoral vote in a number of cities, including the town of Hayange in eastern France. In response, the municipality's sister cities of Arlon in Belgium and Diekirch in Luxembourg have cut official ties with Hayange. The new mayor isn’t bothered, though. His party isn’t just opposed to immigration and in favor of leaving the euro - it also condemns freedom of movement within the EU.

	Altruistic kidney donations in Britain are organized through a program that matches anonymous donors with recipients. Many other countries, Germany included, restrict kidney donation to relatives and others who can demonstrate a close personal connection to the recipient. In Britain, however, non-directed altruistic donation became more common after 2006, when a new authority was set up to regulate organ transplantation. Since then, the number of altruistic kidney donations has risen each year.

	About 25 percent of Austrian teens under age 15 smoke at least once a week. The high smoking rate is exacerbated by the country’s inconsistent non-smoker protection legislation, which allows for numerous exceptions. However, one Austrian citizen has set out to change that by making sure that the laws that do exist are enforced properly. He’s already reported about 7,000 violations to the authorities.

	It's called the Golden Peninsula in the Black Sea. Viewed historically, Crimea is a fascinating place. For millennia, it was home to nomadic tribes such as the Scythians. They left behind valuable gold artefacts, which are currently on show in a large exhibition in Amsterdam. The gold treasure actually belongs to four Crimean museums, but since the peninsula's annexation by Russia, the question has arisen: to whom should the gold artefacts be returned - Ukraine or Crimea - or should they remain in Amsterdam?

	The Veneto is one of Italy's wealthiest regions. But since the economic crisis, many people there are angry that their money is being spent to help the poorer south of the country. That's grist to the mill for the separatists, who are becoming increasingly radical. Recently the Italian police broke up a group which had acquired weapons from the Albanian mafia and planned to declare Venetian independence on St. Mark's Square.

	Portugal adopted western European consumption habits and the throw-away mentality when it joined the European Union. Now every Portuguese uses around 500 plastic tote bags a year, adding their contribution to the EU total of eight billion. That was reason enough for a video maker to poke fun at this aspect of Portuguese lifestyle.

	In other European countries with a hunting tradition, such as Britain or Sweden, using lead ammunition has long been illegal. In Germany, however, it's estimated that as tons of lead are fired in German forests annually.

	To Reinhold Mitterlehner, Austria's Economy Minister, it's long been clear that sanctions are an own goal for his country. In the high season in winter, charter flights from Russia land hourly at the small airports serving Salzburg and Innsbruck. Last year, 1.4 million Russians vacationed in Austria, most in popular ski resorts such as Kitzbühel. Many Russian millionaires and even billionaires have bought property here. In doing so, they're combining business with pleasure, because Austria offers favorable tax conditions to well-heeled private investors.

	The light guerrillas find subjects all over Europe: television towers that are set to be privatized, industrial buildings that face ruin, and building projects that swallow millions in tax money. As soon as it gets dark, they arrange a meeting and light up a building with mobile floodlights for five to ten minutes. Before the owners can react, the light guerrillas have disappeared into the night.

In some regions, one in two girls have become child brides. Since the minimum age for getting married in Turkey is 18, such marriages (even where performed by an imam), are illegal and punishable with a jail sentence. Outraged human rights activists point out that many of the girls end up at the mercy of pedophiles and rapists.
