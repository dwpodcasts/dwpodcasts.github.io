                <dd>Wed, 3 Sep 2014 21:30:00 GMT | In the Romanian region of Carpathia, centuries-old trees are being logged illegally. Over the past decade, about 3,000 hectares of ancient forest have disappeared.
	Even in the famous national parks such as Maramures Park in northern Romania, enormous tracts of land have been logged bare. The lumber is sold for industrial use. Corrupt officials work closely with the logging mafia and the illegal loggers operate with near impunity. Large wood-processing enterprises in the region claim they careful to ensure that all the timber they use has been legally harvested. But conservationists are skeptical of this claim. They argue that the wood-processing industry’s negligence in monitoring the source of the wood they use is what allows illegal logging to thrive.

Now the EU has authorized the administration of veterinary diclofenac to livestock in Spain and Italy - a deadly threat to the four species of vultures that live in Spain. The anti-inflammatory drug has already led to the near-extinction of the vulture population in India, Pakistan and Nepal. The birds ingest the substance when eating the carcasses of cattle treated with the drug, and die of kidney failure.

	The Italian navy has five ships on permanent deployment patrolling the waters. Their mission is to rescue refugees and people in distress and bring them to safety. The refugees who get stranded in Italy are mainly from Syria and east Afridca, but they know they could be deported to their home countries at any time, so they often try to conceal their identities, hoping to stay in Europe.

	The back-breaking work in the fields is considered women’s work in Albania. That was also true under Communism. In the Catholic stronghold of the north, the Kanun also survived the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. Under the Kanun, the wife is considered the husband’s property. He is permitted to beat and even to kill her if she is disobedient or unfaithful. Fabiola Egro is trying to change that. She’s a pivotal figure in the Albanian women’s movement.

	Most farmers in Romania are small-scale producers with a small patch of land. Their production methods are inefficient, and EU law caters to intensive farming, so family farms lose out. Now they also have to adhere to EU-wide hygiene standards, which are proving too expensive for many.

	The Corsican authorities have passed a law requiring anyone who wants to buy a house there to have lived on the island for at least five years. The move is a response to people from mainland France and abroad buying up properties as holiday homes, causing prices to spiral. As a result, many Corsicans can no longer afford to buy property there. But now a few communities are fighting back, and threatening to enforce pre-emption rights -- including the village of Cuttoli near Ajaccio, the birthplace of Napoleon.

But many zoo visitors in Bern are outraged, and some animal rights activists have also been critical of the move.

                <dd>Wed, 9 Apr 2014 21:30:00 GMT | The Portuguese have a dubious claim to fame - their country is known as the "plastic bag" capital of Europe. Every minute, thousands of plastic bags are toted out of shopping centers.
	Portugal adopted western European consumption habits and the throw-away mentality when it joined the European Union. Now every Portuguese uses around 500 plastic tote bags a year, adding their contribution to the EU total of eight billion. That was reason enough for a video maker to poke fun at this aspect of Portuguese lifestyle.

                <dd>Wed, 9 Apr 2014 21:30:00 GMT | The city of Narva, on the outer frontier of the European Union, is falling to bits. The decay has led more and more residents to consider rapprochement with Russia.
	More than ninety percent of Narva's residents are Russian. Since Estonia joined the EU in 2003, they've suffered more and more economically. A few years ago, a former tailoring collective went broke; ending any hope of affluence in what was once a working industrial town. Today Narva is dirt poor. If anyone, anywhere in Europe is longing for the "good old Soviet days," it would be here on Estonia's eastern frontier.

                <dd>Wed, 9 Apr 2014 21:30:00 GMT | Tens of thousands of Chinese laborers supported Allied forces in World War One. A cemetery in northern France is a memorial to their fates.
	The French and British armies recruited millions during World War One. Among those recruits were around 140 thousand Chinese. They were laborers who helped build railway lines or worked in ports and munitions factories in France and Belgium. Conditions were miserable and many died. The largest Chinese cemetery has 841 graves. It is located in Noyelles-sur-Mer, not far from Abbeville. Once a year, Chinese from all over Paris visit the site.

	In other European countries with a hunting tradition, such as Britain or Sweden, using lead ammunition has long been illegal. In Germany, however, it's estimated that as tons of lead are fired in German forests annually. Each year environmentalists say that birds of prey in particular are threatened with lead poisoning when they consume the remains of animals that have been shot. And people are said to be at risk from lead a well.

	According to the city, one-third of the musicians didn’t pass muster at the auditions. Those that did also have to follow new rules, including remaining at least 75 meters away from other buskers. Madrid’s mayor, Ana Botella, has also called for a ban on downtown protests. She has been sharply criticized for these moves and some even say she is more repressive than General Franco.

	Time seems to have stood still in Andermatt. But that may soon be a distant memory. Several months ago, an ultramodern luxury hotel opened there. And if Egyptian investor Samih Sawiris has his way, it will soon be joined by scores of similar hotels and vacation apartments. Sawiris launched his plan after he bought land vacated by the Swiss army, which for decades had been the mainstay of the local economy. Many in Andermatt are hoping that the town will one day rival Davos or St Moritz for Alpine glamour. But not everyone here shares that vision of the future.

	The "children of the transition”, as they call themselves, are determined to continue their activism. They are urging young people who are considering emigration to stay and seek change. The student-led protests have wide support from the many Bulgarians who say their political elite are hopelessly corrupt and the economy is run by a clan of oligarchs. The controversial coalition government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski has faced three votes of no-confidence in just five months.

This development has plunged Siena into crisis.For more than 500 years, Monte dei Paschi presided over the city. For generations, the venerable bank helped fund charities and civic works, including the famed Palio horse races. In 2012 it was revealed that the bank had strained its finances past their limit and had been concealing major losses. Now the city, which had a major stake in the foundation that was the bank’s main shareholder, is facing possible bankruptcy. And it fears that the scandal may harm Siena’s chances to be a 2019 European Capital of Culture.

	In Europe's highest ski resort, Val Thorens, piste attendants have long been aware of a dangerous trend. More and more people are skiing in deep powder snow off-piste. What's new is that most amateur skiers intentionally go out when the risk of avalanche is at its greatest, simply because that's when they can get the best pictures of deep-powder skiing.

	Because of an amnesty, even torturers from the Franco era have been able to live unpunished in Spain. Protection from criminal prosecution was originally meant to facilitate the peaceful transition to democracy. Many victims, however, are demanding that the amnesty be lifted at last. A female judge from Buenos Aires is also seeking belated justice for these victims. Now Spain faces a flood of litigation: some two hundred lawsuits have been filed by Argentinian lawyers living in Madrid. They want to try perpetrators still living in Spain before courts in Argentina.

	To Reinhold Mitterlehner, Austria's Economy Minister, it's long been clear that sanctions are an own goal for his country. In the high season in winter, charter flights from Russia land hourly at the small airports serving Salzburg and Innsbruck. Last year, 1.4 million Russians vacationed in Austria, most in popular ski resorts such as Kitzbühel. Many Russian millionaires and even billionaires have bought property here. In doing so, they're combining business with pleasure, because Austria offers favorable tax conditions to well-heeled private investors.
