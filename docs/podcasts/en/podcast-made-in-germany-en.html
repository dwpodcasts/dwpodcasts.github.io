In a rapidly changing world, MADE in Germany examines the risks and
benefits of digitalization and its impact on the way we work, what we
earn and how we live. The program also investigates the ethics of
business, and showcases young entrepreneurs who are redefining the
workplace. Instead of just crunching the numbers, MADE delves deeper
into issues and also explores the emotional side to stories.

                <dd>Wed, 8 Sep 2021 12:52:00 GMT | Many science fiction films have become cinema classics. Movies in this genre often combine scientific tropes with imaginations of future technology.
