On the Green Fence lives up to its name in looking at complex, often
divisive environmental issues from multiple angles. It’s not about
greenism, but about delving into the major concerns of our time in an
engaging and human way. DW reporter Neil King sits on the fence and
explores the role business, society and science play in our transition
to a more environmentally friendly world. In so doing, he aims to make
sense of issues that affect us all, but which are often over-
simplified or convoluted by ideology and lobbyism. On the Green Fence
stands for an open-minded, relevant and entertaining approach to the
environment.

                <dd>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:40:00 GMT | Germany's new agriculture minister Cem Özdemir has caused a stir after speaking out against junk prices in supermarkets, especially for meat - the biggest driver of food-related greenhouse gas emissions. But why is this so problematic in Germany and would higher meat prices really solve the problem?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/co-housing-a-green-alternative-to-the-family-home/av-60173034?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Co-housing: a green alternative to the family home?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:02:00 GMT | Buying a family home is a major life milestone in many countries. But a lack of affordable housing and a desire to curb carbon footprints has led to the rise of alternative forms of accommodation, including "co-housing." Just how does this model work? And how difficult is it to get people to share their living space?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/housing-rethinking-our-living-space/av-60009598?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Housing: rethinking our living space</a>
                <dd>Fri, 3 Dec 2021 13:56:00 GMT | The average living space in western countries has increased dramatically over the past decades. In Germany, urban sprawl and construction projects are eating away at nature at a rate of 50 soccer pitches per day. At the same time, people here are struggling to find affordable accommodation. How can we break this trend and are tiny houses really the answer?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/keeping-homes-cool-as-the-planet-heats-up/av-59882636?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Keeping homes cool as the planet heats up</a>
                <dd>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 14:48:00 GMT | Climate change is expected to make heat waves longer and more severe, with catastrophic consequences for our health and economies. The International Energy Agency predicts that energy demand from air conditioners will triple by 2050. But ironically, the more we use these carbon-intensive machines, the more we contribute to global heating. So how do we break that cycle?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/reducing-the-carbon-footprint-of-houses/av-59732663?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Reducing the carbon footprint of houses</a>
                <dd>Fri, 5 Nov 2021 12:48:00 GMT | In Germany, nearly 40% of national greenhouse gas emissions are caused by buildings. The housing and construction sector will need to change dramatically if there is to be any hope of achieving climate neutrality by 2045. But where to start? Listen in to find out more about passive houses, sustainable construction materials and the carbon footprint of building a family home from scratch.

                <dd>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 14:15:00 GMT | Three months after deadly flash floods tore through Germany's Ahr Valley, residents in the village of Dernau are looking to the future. For many, that means rebuilding homes destroyed in the deluge. But how do you build back in a sustainable way? What needs to change to make buildings more flood-resilient? And when does it make sense to move away altogether?

                <dd>Fri, 8 Oct 2021 09:36:00 GMT | This time On the Green Fence is bringing you an episode from our friends at Outside/In, an American podcast about the natural world and how we use it. In their episode "Scents and Sensibility" the Outside/In team explore the origins, role and transformation of potpourri. Listen in for a unique take on this "old school" air freshener.

                <dd>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 10:41:00 GMT | Growing up in a working-class neighborhood in western Germany, environmental issues had never really played a role for brothers Adnan and Burak Arslan. But when Adnan was selected to be a part of a citizens' assembly on climate change, his view began to shift — to the surprise of his friends and family.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-can-we-save-our-dying-forests/av-59144515?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">How can we save our dying forests?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:27:00 GMT | Climate change and severe droughts have weakened forests around the globe. In Germany, where many forests are planted monocultures, about 80% of trees are considered unhealthy. What's even more alarming is that the forest dieback is also affecting younger trees now. So what happens if we lose our forests? And is there anything we can do to stop it?

                <dd>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:15:00 GMT | Germany's demographic setup favors the older generation in this year's crunch election. More than half the eligible voters are above the age of 50 and only 15% are below the age of 30. What does this mean for intergenerational dialogue and future environmental policy? Are older people in Germany really less interested in the environment than the Friday For Futures generation?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/introducing-fireline/av-58852094?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Introducing: Fireline</a>
                <dd>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 07:49:00 GMT | This week, On the Green Fence brings you another environment podcast we think you'll enjoy: Fireline. Wildfires across the United States are getting bigger, hotter and more devastating. But what does all this fire really mean — for the West, for firefighters and for everyday folks? And what's it really like to fight fire on the ground?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-does-an-e-car-startup-crack-germany-s-auto-market/av-58608329?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">How does an e-car startup crack Germany's auto market?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 08:00:00 GMT | Germany's car industry is among the most competitive in the world. But Aachen-based engineering professor Günther Schuh believes he can carve out a space for his electric car startup: e.Go Mobile. He says his small e-vehicles are among the most sustainable models around, and have a role to play in the transition to zero-emission mobility.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-benefits-of-a-car-free-future/av-58277042?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">The benefits of a car-free future</a>
                <dd>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:00:00 GMT | Most urban centers around the world are designed for cars, with significant chunks of space dedicated to roads and parking spaces. But what if our infrastructure was geared towards pedestrians and cyclists instead? Advocates say shifting away from car-centric cities could bring huge benefits to our health and climate.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-problematic-is-e-mobility-s-reliance-on-lithium/av-58134192?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">How problematic is e-mobility's reliance on lithium?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 2 Jul 2021 09:24:00 GMT | Lithium is a critical component of e-car batteries. As demand for electric cars soars, this raw material could be heading for severe bottlenecks very soon if lithium production isn't ramped up dramatically. But what does this mean for the environment and just how far can we get with the 86 million tons of lithium resources currently identified globally?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/is-volkswagen-s-accelerated-e-car-strategy-a-game-changer/av-57950050?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Is Volkswagen's accelerated e-car strategy a game changer?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 11:48:00 GMT | If Germany wants to meet its target of getting 10 million electric cars on the road by the end of the decade, the country's car industry needs to change gears fast. Faced with ever stricter EU regulation and CO2 limits, Volkswagen Group has announced plans to roll out 70% of the core brand in Europe as e-cars by 2030. But just how sustainable is their new e-car strategy?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-germany-s-road-map-for-climate-friendly-cars/av-57778718?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">What is Germany's road map for climate-friendly cars?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 4 Jun 2021 13:12:00 GMT | There are 1.5 billion cars in the world today. These combustion engine vehicles are major polluters, and governments are hoping to meet their climate targets by replacing them with lower-emission alternatives, such as electric cars. But this transformation is going to be a massive challenge, and it's already proving to be extremely divisive in Germany — one of the world's leading car producers.

                <dd>Fri, 21 May 2021 07:01:00 GMT | Humans have long been driven by a desire to explore the planet and visit faraway places. But with tourism's toll on the environment now calling our globetrotting habits into question, some say it's time for change. But just how realistic is this given that people are itching to travel freely again once the Covid-19 pandemic is over?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-a-green-hotel-look-like/av-57459288?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">What does a green hotel look like?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 7 May 2021 12:07:00 GMT | The accommodation you book as a tourist has a major impact on how eco-friendly your holiday is. A Bavarian hotel owner in one of Germany's most popular tourist destinations promises carbon-neutral stays. But how does this work?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/saving-a-thai-beach-paradise-from-mass-tourism/av-57286705?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Saving a Thai beach paradise from mass tourism</a>
                <dd>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:17:00 GMT | The iconic cove from "The Beach" movie is slowly starting to recover from the onslaught of mass tourism. Thai authorities had sealed it off to the public in 2018 after almost all the coral was destroyed. Now tourism operators and local stakeholders struggling under the pandemic are urging the authorities to reopen the beach. But how can the environmental recovery be secured if this happens?

                <dd>Fri, 9 Apr 2021 07:01:00 GMT | Flying is one of the most polluting and privileged forms of travel. The aviation industry is facing growing pressure to wean itself off fossil fuels to bring down CO2 emissions. Can it succeed? Or do we need to stop flying altogether?
