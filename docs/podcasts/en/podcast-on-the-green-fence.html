On the Green Fence lives up to its name in looking at complex, often
divisive environmental issues from multiple angles. It’s not about
greenism, but about delving into the major concerns of our time in an
engaging and human way. DW reporter Neil King sits on the fence and
explores the role business, society and science play in our transition
to a more environmentally friendly world. In so doing, he aims to make
sense of issues that affect us all, but which are often over-
simplified or convoluted by ideology and lobbyism. On the Green Fence
stands for an open-minded, relevant and entertaining approach to the
environment.

                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/is-volkswagen-s-accelerated-e-car-strategy-a-game-changer/av-57950050?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Is Volkswagen's accelerated e-car strategy a game changer?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 11:48:00 GMT | If Germany wants to meet its target of getting 10 million electric cars on the road by the end of the decade, the country's car industry needs to change gears fast. Faced with ever stricter EU regulation and CO2 limits, Volkswagen Group has announced plans to roll out 70% of the core brand in Europe as e-cars by 2030. But just how sustainable is their new e-car strategy?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-germany-s-road-map-for-climate-friendly-cars/av-57778718?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">What is Germany's road map for climate-friendly cars?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 4 Jun 2021 13:12:00 GMT | There are 1.5 billion cars in the world today. These combustion engine vehicles are major polluters, and governments are hoping to meet their climate targets by replacing them with lower-emission alternatives, such as electric cars. But this transformation is going to be a massive challenge, and it's already proving to be extremely divisive in Germany — one of the world's leading car producers.

                <dd>Fri, 21 May 2021 07:01:00 GMT | Humans have long been driven by a desire to explore the planet and visit faraway places. But with tourism's toll on the environment now calling our globetrotting habits into question, some say it's time for change. But just how realistic is this given that people are itching to travel freely again once the Covid-19 pandemic is over?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-a-green-hotel-look-like/av-57459288?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">What does a green hotel look like?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 7 May 2021 12:07:00 GMT | The accommodation you book as a tourist has a major impact on how eco-friendly your holiday is. A Bavarian hotel owner in one of Germany's most popular tourist destinations promises carbon-neutral stays. But how does this work?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/saving-a-thai-beach-paradise-from-mass-tourism/av-57286705?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Saving a Thai beach paradise from mass tourism</a>
                <dd>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:17:00 GMT | The iconic cove from "The Beach" movie is slowly starting to recover from the onslaught of mass tourism. Thai authorities had sealed it off to the public in 2018 after almost all the coral was destroyed. Now tourism operators and local stakeholders struggling under the pandemic are urging the authorities to reopen the beach. But how can the environmental recovery be secured if this happens?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/does-air-travel-have-a-green-future/av-57140266?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Does air travel have a green future?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 9 Apr 2021 07:01:00 GMT | Flying is one of the most polluting and privileged forms of travel. The aviation industry is facing growing pressure to wean itself off fossil fuels to bring down CO2 emissions. Can it succeed? Or do we need to stop flying altogether?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/can-cruises-kick-start-the-decarbonization-of-shipping/av-57016833?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Can cruises kick-start the decarbonization of shipping?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 13:08:00 GMT | Cruises are among the most carbon-intensive ways to travel, and the sector is growing fast. Cruise ships are also a testing ground for new technologies and alternative fuels, and could help drive change in the shipping industry as a whole. Neil visits Lucienne Damm from TUI Cruises to find out how the German company is planning to meet its target of going climate neutral by 2050.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/overcoming-our-meat-addiction/av-55672311?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Overcoming our meat addiction</a>
                <dd>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:15:00 GMT | Global meat production is predicted to grow 85% by 2050. If this happens, it will have a cataclysmic effect on the environment. So how are we going to feed 10 billion people - who desire meat - without using more land and increasing atmospheric emissions? The answer to this question will have to include meat alternatives. But which ones have a chance? And what's standing in the way?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/hunting-for-sustainable-meat/av-55584991?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Hunting for sustainable meat</a>
                <dd>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:34:00 GMT | Locally hunted game has the smallest environmental footprint of all meat. The downsides of factory farming don’t apply to animals roaming free in the forest. This is why huntress Alena Steinbach won’t eat meat unless it’s killed in the wild. The former vegetarian with a degree in green business management takes Neil and Gabe deep into Europe’s largest forest for a hunt. What will they discover?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/of-vegans-and-men/av-55516649?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Of vegans and men</a>
                <dd>Fri, 6 Nov 2020 10:10:00 GMT | A vegan diet can cut your food-related emissions by 70 percent, but can you really grow big and strong without meat? Bona fide vegan Patrik Baboumian, once Germany’s strongest man, invites meat eaters Neil and Gabe to his vegan gym in Berlin to prove you don’t need chicken breast to grow muscle. But will this be enough to shake their deep-rooted skepticism towards veganism?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/can-you-be-a-good-christian-and-eat-meat/av-55445878?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Can you be a good Christian and eat meat?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:42:00 GMT | As the proverb goes, man is at the top of the food chain. Does that give us the right to kill animals? Rainer Hagencord, a vegetarian priest located in the Silicon Valley of German meat production, preaches against this. His exegesis of the Bible is plunging devout Christians into existential crisis. Some are leaving the church. Others welcome him as a prophetic voice the region deeply needs.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-to-kill-an-animal-humanely/av-55369325?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">How to kill an animal humanely</a>
                <dd>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 10:37:00 GMT | No transport, no suffering: Farmers Michael and Tina Jansen dignify the lives - and death - of their animals. That's why they've sought out mobile butcher Matthias Kürten. He takes his slaughterhouse on wheels to 300 farms each year. Neil and Gabe head to the Jansen homestead and connect with two calves about to be slaughtered. They're going to learn firsthand where meat comes from.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/breaking-down-germany-s-meat-machine/av-55368851?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Breaking down Germany's meat machine</a>
                <dd>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 08:04:00 GMT | Germany's meat industry slaughters over 750 million animals per year, with dire consequences for the environment. After Neil and Gabe's requests to visit meat packing plants are blocked, they talk to both a former food inspector as well as an animal rights activist with a nationwide network of whistleblowers to get the inside story. Their message? Germany's meat industry is out of control.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/degrowth-is-less-really-more/av-53432053?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Degrowth – Is less really more?</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 May 2020 12:00:00 GMT | A world without growth is what Germany’s leading and most radical degrowth proponent Niko Paech sees as the only option after COVID-19. Is the coronavirus crisis helping us realize what really matters in life?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/change-is-only-possible-with-the-crowd/av-53434498?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Change is only possible with the crowd</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 May 2020 10:19:00 GMT | British social psychologist Steve Reicher believes that all social change happens through the collective. Human beings all over the planet endured a serious infringement of their private rights when governments made the decision to lock down amid the COVID-19 crisis. For the most part, there was consensus that this tough decision was correct. But how was that consensus established?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-green-transformation-of-our-world/av-53432055?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">The green transformation of our world</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 May 2020 07:55:00 GMT | Germany’s leading transformation researcher Maja Göpel explains in this podcast episode how to change our world for the better of all. The coronavirus crisis has proved to us that radical change is possible in a short period of time. But can we harness this awareness to bring about systemic change in a bid to avert the looming climate catastrophe?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-death-of-civilization/av-53432054?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">The death of civilization</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 May 2020 07:55:00 GMT | The coronavirus pandemic has exposed how vulnerable our globalized world is. California native Derrick Jensen talks about why he would welcome a return of the stone age. The founder of Deep Green Resistance explains why some radical eco-activists would like to see the collapse of civilization to restore the balance of nature - and what he’s prepared to do to achieve that end.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-holocene-strikes-back/av-53432045?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">The Holocene strikes back</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 May 2020 07:55:00 GMT | Indian environmental economist Pavan Sukhdev explains in this podcast why our interconnectedness with wildlife is central, even though the exact origin of the coronavirus remains disputed. It's brought our world to a virtual standstill - and there are dozens of other pathogens waiting in line for their turn in the viral limelight. Is the Holocene striking back?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/changing-the-grammar-of-our-behavior/av-53432043?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">Changing the grammar of our behavior</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 May 2020 07:55:00 GMT | Why can’t we just change? Germany's leading philosopher Peter Sloterdijk believes that question is at the heart of the climate change conundrum. When the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, the response by governments was immediate. So there is proof that sweeping change on a global scale is possible. Does this provide the precedent for us to avert the looming climate catastrophe?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-matter-of-survival/av-50596073?maca=en-podcast_on_the_green_fence-30407-xml-mrss">A matter of survival</a>
                <dd>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 13:04:00 GMT | When Neil and Gabe start exploring why Germany's insect population has suffered a 75% decline in recent decades, they meet organic farmers, entymologists and lots of mosquitoes, and discover that even tiny things can make a big difference to the health of the planet.
