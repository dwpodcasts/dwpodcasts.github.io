	Anna is back in 2006 and shows Paul the rusty key that is supposed to jam ... blockieren ... the machine. But the machine needs a code. Anna tries the notes contained in DACHFEG's name. Then the woman in red appears and demands the key but Anna sticks it in the machine and enters the code. Will the woman in red stop the destruction of the machine? Or will she, like the machine, become history?

	With only minutes left to complete the mission, the player tells Anna to use the pandemonium to her advantage and to make a quiet exit. But she doesn't want to go without saying a proper goodbye to Paul. Anna does her game save and realises the rusty key is needed to solve the mystery. The music is the other. But can she get back in time to save the day? She only has 5 minutes to successfully complete her mission.

	Time is flying and Anna has to open the metal case. But the player warns her not to do it in front of others. She opens it and finds a rusty old key. Now she has to return to 2006 so she can stop the woman in red. But does she have enough time?

	The player tells Anna to get a ride to Bernauer Straße as time is running out. She hitches a ride on the back of a scooter ridden by a young man, the future inspector Emre Ogur. But just after Anna runs into Heidrun Drei and Paul, the woman in red arrives. Paul and Heidrun Drei's husband Robert throw chunks of the wall at her. In the meantime, Anna gets away to go and retrieve the metal case. But will it still be there after all these years?

	Just as Anna is about to leave for 1989, the bikers appear. The woman in red tells her gang it is imperative that they find ... finden ... Anna. And she wants Anna alive ... lebendig. Anna gets into the time machine and goes back to Berlin in 1989 just as the city is going wild over the fall of the wall. But she's at the Brandenburg Gate where everyone's partying and she has to get to Bernauer Straße. With 30 minutes to go, can she move quickly enough through the crowd of millions in a once divided city?

	Back in 2006, Paul tells her that the priest has disappeared ... verschwunden. The woman in red has kidnapped him. Paul obviously knows more about Pastor Kavalier and the time machine, but there is no time to discuss it. She agrees to go to the evening of November 9, 1989 when an enraptured Berlin is celebrating the fall of the Wall. She wants to retrieve the case amidst all the commotion.

The player tells her to come back to 2006 and then go back to 1989. How dangerous are these leaps in time?Before Anna returns to 2006, there is a passionate farewell from Paul. She only has 35 minutes to complete the mission and she still has to find out the historic event that RATAVA wants to stop. Anna and the player realise that RATAVA is not after the construction but the fall of the wall. The player tells her to come back to 2006 first and then go back to 1989 when the wall fell.

	Anna has to be in East Berlin to succeed in her mission. But she's stuck in the West. Then there's another problem: In this difficult situation, Paul tells her he's in love with her. He wants her to give up the mission. But the player tells her to go back to 2006 to work out another plan. Will 35 minutes be enough for a solution?

	Heidrun Drei, Paul, and Anna head towards Bernauer Straße but on the way they meet Heidrun Drei's husband, Robert. He tells them there are soldiers everywhere. Worse still, the motorbikers are out again. They all hide in the courtyard of an old brasserie. As the woman in red appears, Paul tells Anna that she is the head ... die Chefin ... of RATAVA. The player tells Anna to follow "die Chefin" and with Paul they go into a cellar where they see the woman in red hide a case. They get it and hide it in a different place as they make their escape. The player says he'll think of a way to retrieve it. But with only 40 minutes left, will he have enough time?

	Anna still hasn't realised that the cashier is Heidrun Drei and the player tells her that she has to trust the helpful cashier even if her brother is suspicious. But despite his reservations, he agrees with his sister that they should help Anna elude the motorcycle gang. The three of them go out to look at the East German army, who are starting to build barbed wire fences. The player tells Anna it's the construction of the Berlin Wall. Only 45 minutes left to save Germany.

The cashier takes Anna to her house and tells her that she is an old school chum. Anna is dubious about the move but the player says that she has to trust her. Back at the cashier's house, Anna is introduced to Paul Winkler, her brother.

She has only 55 minutes left to find out RATAVA's target. Is it the construction or destruction of the wall?Now back in 1961, Anna tries to go to Kantstraße. But that's in West Berlin and she is in East Berlin. Anna can't get into the West because the GDR government has started building the Wall. After her latest game update, the player and Anna realise that there are two possible targets: the construction or the destruction of the Berlin Wall. They only have 55 minutes left to find out which is RATAVA's goal.

                <dd>Tue, 17 Jun 2008 12:48:00 GMT | Anna discovers the time machine and is told that a gang of time terrorists are out to erase an historic event. But which one? The player sends her back to 1961. She has only 60 minutes left. Can she trust the pastor?
	The pastor knows the significance of the phrase "In der Teilung liegt die Lösung" and is aware too of the danger posed by RATAVA. The player says Anna has to go back to 1961 to solve the mystery and promises to help her get back once she's there. The pastor gives her the phrase, "Die Liebe versetzt Berge", ... love moves mountains ... which will help her get back. She sets off for August 13, 1961 but with only 60 minutes to finish her mission. Is it enough time?

                <dd>Tue, 17 Jun 2008 12:41:00 GMT | The church proves to be the place for guidance. The pastor explains the tune to Anna and tells her it is a key to a time machine. But what kind of contraption is he talking about?
	When the game is re-started, Anna and the woman in red get in a scuffle but the woman in red runs away as the pastor arrives. He tells Anna that Inspector Ogur is only wounded and recovering in hospital. The pastor plays the tune again and tells her that the music notes D A C H F E G are the key to the machine. The breakthrough gives Anna and the player a 10 minute time bonus. But will it be enough?

	Anna hears a familiar song. The church organ is playing the same melody as the music box. As Anna approaches the organ, she overhears the sexton explaining to a visitor that the organ has been fully restored but has been missing a part, ... ein Element ... since the construction of the wall. Anna realises the box is the missing link and adds it to the organ. As the organ starts playing a trap door opens and Anna finds herself standing in front of the woman in red. She loses another life and only has 60 minutes left.

	Ogur has tipped off Anna about the RATAVA time bandits. Back at the clock shop, Paul Winkler shows her the repaired music box. It plays a tune called "Nostalgie" by Friedrich August Dachfeg.
