                <dd>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 13:02:00 GMT | Outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel really is going to step off that dance floor soon. What better way to end a podcast dedicated to her last dance, i.e.her last year in office, than with a rare exclusive interview? DW's Max Hofmann waltzed the German chancellor through the interview and has the backstory for us in this final episode of "Merkel's last dance."

But there are huge issues for the next government to address. As Olaf Scholz works to establish a new coalition, we ask his party's foreign policy spokesman what the world can expect from a Germany under Scholz's leadership.

September’s elections have elevated them to new levels of political power. The current rounds of exploratory and coalition talks will determine just how green Germany will go from here.

                <dd>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 16:55:00 GMT | The beginning of the end of the Merkel era is here. A narrow win for the SPD under Olaf Scholz has left Merkel's camp damaged, and given unprecedented leverage to the "kingmakers," the neoliberal FDP and Greens, in the search for a new coalition. In the latest edition of Merkel's Last Dance we catch up on the state of play and speak to potential FDP Foreign Minister, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff.

                <dd>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:17:00 GMT | Compared to other world leaders, Merkel is seen as the one leading the charge in the global effort to combat climate change. But, says Claudia Kemfert, she’s also had a number of disappointing moves, like extending the use of nuclear power, siding with the car lobby, and not exiting coal sooner.

But how much is the chancellor herself to blame? In this episode, Merkel’s top digital advisor talks to DW’s chief technology correspondent Janosch Delcker about Big Tech, digital deficits exposed by the pandemic, and what reforms are needed to get Germany out of this mess.

But: in her 15 years as German chancellor, what has she done for the equality of the sexes and for moving gender fairness forward?
