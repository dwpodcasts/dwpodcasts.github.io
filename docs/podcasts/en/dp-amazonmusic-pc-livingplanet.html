                <dd>Thu, 6 Jan 2022 15:00:00 GMT | We live on a watery planet — nearly three-quarters of the Earth's surface is underwater. As climate change raises temperatures, water is being pushed in new and more extreme directions. But are there ways we could use water to our advantage, environmentally? This week, we hear from communities trying to push back the seas and others suffering from diminishing water supplies.

                <dd>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 13:00:00 GMT | This week, we bring you an episode of DW's On the Green Fence, hosted by Neil King. In it, he heads to the forest in search of urgent answers on how to save them. Around the globe, climate change and severe droughts have wrought havoc on forests far and wide. As forest dieback increases, even young trees are dying. So what happens if we lose our forests? And what we can do to stop it?

                <dd>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 13:00:00 GMT | In this special episode, we reflect on a year of environmental reporting that’s taken us from the northern stretches of oil-producing Russia to the frog-filled forests of Australia. We listen back to snippets of our favorite stories and interviews, reliving the most important environmental events of 2021, along with the funny, weird and mind-blowing moments on Living Planet in the year gone by.

                <dd>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:00:00 GMT | How should we construct our houses and cities to better withstand a changing climate? This week we explore building strategies that reduce emissions and deal with new climate realities. From the promise of hydrogen fueling neighborhoods and businesses, to towns and cities that are using flooding to their advantage, we dig into how we can better design the places we live.

                <dd>Thu, 9 Dec 2021 15:20:00 GMT | From new words in the dictionary to new migration patterns for plants, animals and humans, we dig into ways that climate change is transforming more than just the weather. We also take a look at one tight-lipped contributor to greenhouse gas emissions that is rarely talked about, despite being one of the world's top emitters.

                <dd>Thu, 2 Dec 2021 15:30:00 GMT | Today on the show, we climb up into the Scottish Highlands in search of the country's last patches of snow. We also talk about how the world's waste problem could be solved if companies were responsible for repairing the products they sell and cleaning up the rubbish from packaging they produce. And we hear from a group of women in India taking trash clean-up into their own hands.

                <dd>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 16:30:00 GMT | We head to the Comoros Islands, where the world's demand for ylang ylang oil is leaving the region bare and its makers shorthanded. And hear why environmental groups and politicians in Barcelona are angry over plans to attract more tourists. Plus, we speak with a journalist who has investigated the influence of the fossil fuel industry in American schools' climate change education.

                <dd>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:05:00 GMT | Delegates are running out of time to agree on how to keep global temperatures in check at the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Young people especially are piling on the pressure for action. We hear from DW reporters covering the event and get their impressions. And in Senegal, emissions reductions come too late for the survival of one coastal community already dealing with rising sea levels.

                <dd>Thu, 4 Nov 2021 14:00:00 GMT | This week, we're talking about the biggest environment event of the year – the global climate conference known as COP26. We hear from one of our reporters who's there in Glasgow covering the policy tussles and from an activist who traveled there from Nigeria to make her voice heard, along with many other young people. We also take a look at how climate change is affecting people's lives right now.

                <dd>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:30:00 GMT | Rising waters in 17 lakes in Kenya - including Lake Baringo and Lake Bogoria - are displacing people and upending ways of life. Not to mention, it's stressing out wildlife like giraffes that have been stuck on a newly created island by the high waters. In this feature, we look at how people and animals are coping in the East African Rift Valley.

                <dd>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:30:00 GMT | On this week's show, we have stories of environmental concerns colliding with symbols of cultural importance. We venture to the spot in Italy where marble for Michelangelo's sculptures once came from. Controversy is also stirring on some mountains in Greece, as wind turbines anger locals. And we hear from a journalist who tracked an endangered leopard through war-ravaged territory.

                <dd>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 07:30:00 GMT | Around the world, local people fight to maintain their way of life and habitats. In Cameroon, the Baka people are being driven out of their forests by logging and mining. In the US, a new lithium mine threatens to infringe on Indigenous sacred sites. And in Sierra Leone, an expensive, internationally-funded industrial fishing habor could ruin residents' livelihoods and the local ecosystem.

                <dd>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:40:00 GMT | Most religions have a connection to the Earth – stories of creation or spiritual practices tied to nature. We take a look at how religion and spirituality influence how we treat the environment. From beliefs steeped in the forest to religious leaders motivating their congregants to take care of the planet. And what happens when holy sites are threatened by climate change and too many visitors?

What's its role in greenhouse gas emissions? And what are alternative ways to cool ourselves as the planet heats up? And we venture to Ireland to hear why peatlands are actually a huge deal when it comes to the climate.

But oil is a leading contributor to climate change and can lead to leaks and spills that pollute waterways and ecosystems. As the world gets more serious about shifting away from fossil fuels, the future for oil looks tenuous.

                <dd>Thu, 4 Feb 2021 15:00:00 GMT | Is it possible to fly with a clear environmental conscience? And, if not, what is being done to make this a reality? We follow one couple's journey to find out where carbon offsetting donations from flights actually end up. We also get into the nitty-gritty of a new United Nations emissions deal for flying that has been criticized as being too weak to make a difference.

Forest defenders in Romania are standing up to the so-called "wood mafia" — and paying a high price for that. We hear about a unique method to regenerate "underground forests" in Africa's Sahel. And helping salmon in Scotland recover — by planting trees.

                <dd>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT | Although freshwater sustains us in so many ways, it's often taken for granted — until it's gone. Peatlands drained for palm oil plantations in Indonesia exact an ecological and human toll. Kenya's Athi River, once a prime tourist attraction, has become a stinking cesspool. And, Bhutan banks on hydropower for its clean energy development.

In Spain, we explore whether the coronavirus pandemic could boost ecotourism. And, lynx are hunted in Latvia, despite being protected in the EU. We join a group of hunters to investigate wildlife management in the Baltic country — and they gut an elk. Plus, Kenya's next wave — of locusts.

But not everyone is convinced that the new scheme will work. We also explore the environmental toll of our consumption, especially our digital gadgets. And we take a look at the emotional toll online activism can take on environmentalists.

Producing that turkey, ham or roast beef has a huge environmental footprint, and most of the animals are not treated well. Living Planet is joined by On the Green Fence to discuss the meat paradox — and whether it's possible to eat animals and still have a clear conscience.
