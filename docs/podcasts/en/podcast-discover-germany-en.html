The gabled buildings and imposing brick churches are a reminder of the city's historic wealth. Stralsund, also a Hanseatic city, is a UNESCO world heritage site. In its old town, five hundred buildings spanning eight centuries are listed as heritage sites. The old city hall is considered a gem of northern German Brick Gothic - a style often characterised by shimmering red bricks. The seaside village of Binz on Germany's largest island of Rügen, boasts a beautiful vista of white villas.
