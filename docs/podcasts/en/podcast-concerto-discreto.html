                <dd>Thu, 4 Feb 2010 13:15:00 GMT | Israelis Shirley Brill and Jonathen Aner merge their talents as clarinetist and pianist, respectively, in their dynamic "Duo Brillaner."At 13 years of age, Jonathan Aner heard Sharon Kam playing the clarinet and immediately fell in love with the sound - so much so, that he wanted give up playing the piano for the clarinet. Fortunately, he didn't do that, but he did encounter another clarinetist some years later: Shirley Brill. The two Israelis ended up becoming a couple, both on and off stage - dubbing themselves "Duo Brillaner" in 1999. 
Brill studied at the Jerusalem Music Center, while Aner attended the University of Music and Drama in Hanover, Germany. Brill continued her training at the University of Music in Luebeck, Germany, as well as at the New England Conservatory in Boston.
 
Fans of the Concerto Discreto series could enjoy the duo's harmonious interaction at a concert on February 1, 2010, in which they played a wide variety from the clarinet repertoire - from Carl Maria von Weber's virtuoso "Grand duo" for clarinet and piano to composer and clarinetist Joerg Widmann's "Fantasy." Widmann himself was slated to be the performer and composer of the evening, but his last-minute cancellation turned out to be a stroke of luck for the audience, who could appreciate the "blind date" with the two Berlin-based musicians - the Duo Brillaner.

Bermange is a promising young musical composer, and in combination with Crowley, more than just a piano accompanist.

                <dd>Fri, 29 Jan 2010 16:43:00 GMT | "The world will surely hear about him…," wrote one enthusiastic critic about Serge Zimmermann from Cologne, Germany. The quote became the title of this Concerto Discreto concert.Born in Cologne in 1991, Zimmermann comes from a family of musicians. His father is the renowned violinist Frank-Peter Zimmermann, and his mother began to teach him the violin when he was five years old. In 2000, he gave his orchestral debut with a Mozart violin concerto. 
 
Five years later, he played his first recital in the German city of Essen; his interpretation of the Bruch Violin Concerto in 2006 garnered him enthusiastic press reviews. One raved, "…even the orchestra joined in the audience's rejoicing."
