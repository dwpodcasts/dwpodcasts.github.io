                <dd>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:20:00 GMT | Oil is big business. It's an industry that employs an estimated 6 million people from Russia to Saudi Arabia to the US. But oil is a leading contributor to climate change and can lead to leaks and spills that pollute waterways and ecosystems. As the world gets more serious about shifting away from fossil fuels, the future for oil looks tenuous.

                <dd>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 15:00:00 GMT | We hear of efforts to breathe life back into seabeds off the coast of Scotland, East African farmers cash in on the Global North’s avocado obsession — which has had dire consequences for the environment elsewhere in the world, and a professional frog nerd takes us through the bizarre and bountiful world of frog songs.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/fighting-coal-in-ghana-ibiza-s-ancient-seeds-the-art-of-climate-science-and-germany-s-car-questions/av-57843956?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Fighting coal in Ghana, Ibiza's ancient seeds, the art of climate science and Germany's car questions</a>
                <dd>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 14:00:00 GMT | We examine how thinking outside the box can lead to changes big and small. 2020 Goldman Environmental Prize winner Chibeze Ezekiel tells us how he led a successful grassroots campaign against Ghana's first coal-fired power plant. We find out how we can make sense of science through art. Female farmers discover the power of ancient seeds on Ibiza. And we delve into Germany's car-conundrum.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-agribiz-making-denim-corporate-greenwashing/av-57757281?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Agribiz, making denim & corporate greenwashing</a>
                <dd>Thu, 3 Jun 2021 10:00:00 GMT | From shocks to industrial agriculture in the face of a dramatically changing climate in the US' Midwest, to a big bank funding rubber plantations in the Congo Basin, and lastly, the growth of the global denim market, we hear about some of the environmental costs of farming, finance and fashion, as well as attempts to reduce the industrial footprint — and whether those can be trusted.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-defining-wilderness-rebroadcast/av-57684627?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Defining wilderness (rebroadcast)</a>
                <dd>Thu, 27 May 2021 13:00:00 GMT | Today on the show we ask some deep environmental questions: What rights does nature have? Should people be considered separate from the natural world? What IS wilderness? And: wild hungry animals on the search for food in Tel Aviv.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-diy-solutions-for-the-south-african-veld-community-gardens-busy-beehives-and-secondhand-clothing/av-57598019?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: DIY solutions for the South African veld, community gardens, busy beehives and secondhand clothing</a>
                <dd>Thu, 20 May 2021 13:35:00 GMT | When communities face challenges they often find their own, homemade fixes. Community-run gardens around the world can be life-changing operations, and the bees that help pollinate them need our help. Meanwhile landscape restoration teams in South Africa are saving the ancient veld and recycling imported clothing has been a creative opportunity for one designer in Kenya.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-unexpected-ideas/av-57508978?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Unexpected ideas</a>
                <dd>Thu, 13 May 2021 13:00:00 GMT | On this week's show, Spain grapples with the environmental impact of the renewable energy boom. Young entrepreneurs in Kenya discover how a tiny critter can make a big impact on food waste. And Mexico takes the lead in kicking the herbicide glyphosate to the curb for the sake of its native bees.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-freedom-farming-and-food-security/av-57449890?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet : Freedom, farming and food security</a>
                <dd>Thu, 6 May 2021 15:00:00 GMT | Across the world, people are having to rethink the way they grow food in the face of the impacts of climate change and industrial agriculture. We hear from seed guardians in Ecuador trying to save vital seed varieties from disappearing, and from farmers in East Africa battling deadly invisible toxins in their crops. Plus: An organic farming group's ambitious plan to green the desert in Egypt.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-pledges-pollution-and-protests/av-57379367?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Pledges, pollution and protests</a>
                <dd>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 14:30:00 GMT | We dissect US President Joe Biden's pledge to cut his country's greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. Protesters in Serbia sound off on big polluters, while a city in the UK takes the initiative to clean up its dirty air. And we discuss how international travel to picturesque destinations really impacts the environment in the Global South.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-earth-day-eco-activists-on-tiktok-and-nuclear-energy-post-chernobyl/av-57294258?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Earth Day, eco activists on TikTok and nuclear energy post-Chernobyl</a>
                <dd>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:00:00 GMT | In this episode of Living Planet, we hear about some of the different ways ordinary people relate to environmental issues in different parts of the world. Climate activists talk about using TikTok to reach Generation Z. And 35 years after the Chernobyl disaster, we'll hear how people in Russia and China view the future of nuclear energy.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-exploring-glacial-caves-the-fight-over-meatless-lunches-and-niger-delta-women-stand-up-to-oil-pollution/av-57215004?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Exploring glacial caves, the fight over meatless lunches and Niger Delta women stand up to oil pollution</a>
                <dd>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:00:00 GMT | This week on Living Planet, stories of how local movers and shakers deal with global problems. Glaciologists in Oregon tell us what they've learned about the climate from frozen caves, while a community in Lyon, France protests meatless school lunches. We also debate the ethics of traveling by cruise or by plane. And women from the Niger Delta share their fight for justice over oil pollution.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-now-or-never-the-planet-s-biggest-environmental-problems-part-2/av-57075550?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Now or never: The planet's biggest environmental problems — part 2</a>
                <dd>Thu, 8 Apr 2021 13:00:00 GMT | From species extinction to waste, land degradation to climate change and pollution, from Kenya to Australia, India, and France, this two-part special explores some of the most urgent environmental problems facing the planet — and how they might be solved. In part two, we hear about deforestation in Kashmir, puzzling water scarcity in Kenya and attempts to reduce severe air pollution in Delhi.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-now-or-never-the-planet-s-biggest-environmental-problems-part-1/av-57075398?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Now or never: The planet's biggest environmental problems — part 1</a>
                <dd>Thu, 1 Apr 2021 14:00:00 GMT | From species extinction to waste, land degradation to climate change and pollution, from Kenya to Australia, India, and France, this two-part special explores some of the most urgent environmental problems facing the planet — and how they might be solved. In part one, we hear about the struggle to save a native Tasmanian species from extinction, plus: French solutions to a sickening waste pile.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-water-wars/av-56995360?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Water wars</a>
                <dd>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:00:00 GMT | In the Global North, clean water is taken for granted — but in some places it means the difference between life and death. "Water wars" are taking place as people fight failing systems, and combat climate change, to access enough clean water for all. From Chile to South Africa, India to the Caribbean, we hear about those water conflicts that are flowing beneath the surface.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-long-suffering-indispensable-trees/av-56916186?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Long-suffering, indispensable trees</a>
                <dd>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 17:55:00 GMT | Trees are often seen as something to be chopped down for economic gain or cleared to make way for development. But without them, scientists warn, humanity loses an important lifeline. These carbon sinks can be thought of as giant air conditioners that cool the planet — a powerful tool in mitigating climate change. From Costa Rica to Brazil, Rome to Madrid, we hear about the state of our trees.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-rethinking-farming/av-56839563?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Rethinking farming</a>
                <dd>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 15:00:00 GMT | We depend on farming — and farmers — to grow the food we need to survive. Agriculture can be environmentally damaging — yet there are alternatives. From adjusting our avocado consumption, to a sustainable (and underrated) crop of the future: beans. And finally, restoring rivers to boost harvests in India.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-fossil-fuel-s-last-gasp/av-56771498?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Fossil fuel's last gasp?</a>
                <dd>Thu, 4 Mar 2021 15:00:00 GMT | As more countries seek to phase in renewable energies, coal retains a firm grip in many parts of the world. In India, the picturesque state of Goa is set to become the country's new coal hub. China's plans to cut back on carbon emissions don't line up with its dependence on coal. And in London, activists can't agree on the best path to net-zero emissions.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-sustainability-the-city/av-56698341?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Sustainability & the city</a>
                <dd>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 14:30:00 GMT | This week on the show, we're taking a look at our cities. From our food systems to transportation and urban planning to our waste streams, we dive into the ways in which urban life can be environmentally-friendly. We also get to hear from some little critters who are taking unwelcome refuge in cities.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-big-ideas/av-56613011?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Big ideas</a>
                <dd>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:00:00 GMT | As our planet faces unprecedented environmental crises, it's becoming clear that piecemeal solutions can't fix the problem. We hear about transformational change, and how we might get there. UNDP chief Achim Steiner speaks to whether it's possible to decouple progress from environmental damage, and we look at "degrowth" as an alternative. Plus, the trees of Philadelphia.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-raptors-illegally-hunted-in-scotland-protecting-vultures-and-cranes-in-kenya-spain-s-trash-gobbling-storks/av-56538508?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Raptors illegally hunted in Scotland, protecting vultures and cranes in Kenya, Spain's trash-gobbling storks</a>
                <dd>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:00:00 GMT | Whether you consider yourself a birder or find the avian kind tend rather to ruffle your feathers, there's no denying birds are a critical part of the natural world. But in too many cases, birds are under threat. We visit the moors of Scotland, where eagles get illegally killed; and Kenya, where vultures and the African crane are in decline. Plus: Storks in Spain addicted to junk food.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-to-fly-or-not-to-fly-the-truth-behind-carbon-offsetting/av-56454824?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: To fly or not to fly? The truth behind carbon offsetting</a>
                <dd>Thu, 4 Feb 2021 15:00:00 GMT | Is it possible to fly with a clear environmental conscience? And, if not, what is being done to make this a reality? We follow one couple's journey to find out where carbon offsetting donations from flights actually end up. We also get into the nitty-gritty of a new United Nations emissions deal for flying that has been criticized as being too weak to make a difference.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet- feeding-forests/av-56372894?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Feeding forests</a>
                <dd>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT | We find out how we can feed forests so they can sustain us. Forest defenders in Romania are standing up to the so-called "wood mafia" — and paying a high price for that. We hear about a unique method to regenerate "underground forests" in Africa's Sahel. And helping salmon in Scotland recover — by planting trees.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-the-ways-we-need-water/av-56301101?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: The ways we need water</a>
                <dd>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT | Although freshwater sustains us in so many ways, it's often taken for granted — until it's gone. Peatlands drained for palm oil plantations in Indonesia exact an ecological and human toll. Kenya's Athi River, once a prime tourist attraction, has become a stinking cesspool. And, Bhutan banks on hydropower for its clean energy development.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-out-and-about/av-56224347?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Out and about</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT | As rising numbers of COVID-19 infections keep us home, you may be dreaming of getting out and about. In Spain, we explore whether the coronavirus pandemic could boost ecotourism. And, lynx are hunted in Latvia, despite being protected in the EU. We join a group of hunters to investigate wildlife management in the Baltic country — and they gut an elk. Plus, Kenya's next wave — of locusts.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-greener-pastures-post-brexit-invisible-waste-the-abuse-environmentalists-face-online/av-56159163?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Greener pastures post-Brexit, invisible waste & the abuse environmentalists face online</a>
                <dd>Thu, 7 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT | This week on the show, we hear how new measures in the UK will use English farms to address environmental problems. But not everyone is convinced that the new scheme will work. We also explore the environmental toll of our consumption, especially our digital gadgets. And we take a look at the emotional toll online activism can take on environmentalists.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-some-greats-from-a-grueling-year/av-56011254?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Some greats from a grueling year</a>
                <dd>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 15:00:00 GMT | In this year-end special, we reflect on the challenges of the pandemic and beyond. From lockdown benefitting sea turtles, to a resourceful biogas solution, to taking the time for new DIY projects like gathering your own food — we listen back to a few of the year's strongest stories about resilience in the face of adversity.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-your-holiday-meat/av-56011255?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Your holiday meat</a>
                <dd>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 15:00:00 GMT | On this special Christmas episode, we talk about meat. Producing that turkey, ham or roast beef has a huge environmental footprint, and most of the animals are not treated well. Living Planet is joined by On the Green Fence to discuss the meat paradox — and whether it's possible to eat animals and still have a clear conscience.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-buggin-out/av-55975640?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Buggin' out</a>
                <dd>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 15:00:00 GMT | It's all about insects! We'll find out how the "murder hornet" could spread across the US and Europe, the ways in which climate change is challenging beekeepers in Botswana, and why scientists are racing to document populations of edible insects in South Africa.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/living-planet-green-politics/av-55895051?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss">Living Planet: Green politics</a>
                <dd>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 15:00:00 GMT | When it comes to the environment, politics has a big role to play. This is top of mind as the Paris Agreement enters its fifth year. This week, we take a look at the rise of the Greens in Germany, as well as one country that is at top of the class when it comes to meeting their Paris commitments. We also explore the changing political environment in the United States.
