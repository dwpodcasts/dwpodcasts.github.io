                <dd>Wed, 3 Nov 2021 16:06:00 GMT | First dose, second dose, booster shot… and then? BioNTech's co-founder gave DW an update.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-not-like-the-other/av-59667057?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Not like the other</a>
                <dd>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 15:48:00 GMT | Why are vaccinated people dying less often from non-COVID factors, too? Also, there was never any good reason to exclude women from research for being too 'emotionally variable' during menstruation — and now there's data to prove it.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/women-men-emotions/av-59655768?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Women, men & emotions</a>
                <dd>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:24:00 GMT | Men, a new study has shown, are just as "moody" as women — no matter what time of the month it is.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-can-i-check-my-immunity/av-59621217?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19: Can I check my immunity?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 15:55:00 GMT | Over time, the protective power of a COVID-19 vaccination (or recovery) goes down. Could an antibody test tell you by how much?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-in-your-head/av-59588096?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — In your head</a>
                <dd>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:11:00 GMT | The evidence is in. Just by focusing your thoughts every day, you really can reduce the stress inside your body. Also, a wildly fascinating experiment out of Munich hints at a future where human beings... maybe don't have to breathe anymore?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/mindfulness-reduces-stress-measurably/av-59578644?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Mindfulness reduces stress — measurably</a>
                <dd>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:52:00 GMT | Certain forms of meditation do actually lower stress levels over the long term. And scientists from Germany have proven it by looking at human hair.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-delta-plus-variant/av-59564519?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">The delta plus variant</a>
                <dd>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 14:45:00 GMT | It's been called the "most infectious" variant yet. So what do we know about delta plus?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/do-we-have-to-breathe-to-stay-alive/av-59539955?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Do we have to breathe to stay alive?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 15:31:00 GMT | It sounds like a weird question. But researchers in Germany have shown that algae, if injected into the bloodstream, can provide oxygen to sustain a brain. It worked on tadpoles — could it work on humans, too?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-rectal/av-59517902?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Rectal</a>
                <dd>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 03:05:00 GMT | Like the COVID-19 vaccines? Then you'll love the way mRNA is being tried out on certain cancers. Also, a human stool sample from thousands of years ago reeks of surprisingly high living.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-we-can-learn-from-a-pile-of-poo-in-a-salt-mine/av-59508314?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">What we can learn from a pile of poo in a salt mine</a>
                <dd>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:05:00 GMT | Nearly 3,000 years ago, someone in an Austrian mine pulled down their trousers — and gave scientists an astonishing glimpse into their rich culture.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-vaccine-for-cancer/av-59492290?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">A vaccine for cancer?</a>
                <dd>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:43:00 GMT | Yes, there really is a cancer vaccine being tested in Europe and the US right now. So who is it for, and when will we (hopefully) see it in hospitals? Also, should we feed antibiotics to wild mice to stop the spread of Lyme disease?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-space-sex-covid-19/av-59438472?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Space sex & COVID-19</a>
                <dd>Sat, 9 Oct 2021 03:05:00 GMT | How do astronauts deal with their sex drives when they're up in space for months on end? And why is it so embarrassing to even ask that question? Also, mRNA vaccines have, in very rare cases, led to a treatable heart condition called myocarditis — and scientists may have figured out why.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/when-do-side-effects-happen-from-covid-19-vaccines/av-59438470?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">When do side effects happen from COVID-19 vaccines?</a>
                <dd>Thu, 7 Oct 2021 12:59:00 GMT | Side effects from COVID-19 vaccines are really, really rare. But, if you're one of the unlucky ones, when would you find out? Also, the "supermarket question" has now been answered, and a few dozen mice had BioNTech-Pfizer injected right into their tails — and may have helped solve the heart inflammation mystery.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-what-screens-are-doing-to-us/av-59379478?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — What screens are doing to us</a>
                <dd>Fri, 1 Oct 2021 15:31:00 GMT | What is "Zoom dysmorphia," and why are doctors in the US seeing so many cases of it? Also, new data show that kids are spending up to 30 hours a week staring at screens — and that might be OK.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/it-ll-be-more-difficult-to-vaccinate-kids/av-59366532?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">'It'll be more difficult' to vaccinate kids</a>
                <dd>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:22:00 GMT | Kids over 12 are getting vaccinated — so it'll be easy to do the under-12s, too, right? Not according to the head of Germany's vaccine commission.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/astronauts-have-sex-drives-too/av-59354943?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Astronauts have sex drives, too</a>
                <dd>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 14:13:00 GMT | Why are we all pretending that sex and masturbation don't happen in space?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-do-i-look-so-ugly/av-59329572?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why do I look so ugly?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:39:00 GMT | Around the US, doctors have seen an increase in the number of people who are unhappy with how they look. One suspected culprit: Videoconferencing.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-kids-dogs-and-political-instability/av-59301636?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup: Kids, dogs and political instability</a>
                <dd>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 03:25:00 GMT | The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine works great on 5-to-11-year-olds — so why isn't Germany in a rush to vaccinate them? Also, if you've felt a bit agitated during the pandemic, come on in.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/screen-time-kids-it-may-not-matter/av-59300835?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Screen time & kids — it may not matter</a>
                <dd>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 15:31:00 GMT | Children in the US spend four hours per day staring at tablets, phones, TVs or video games. And as shocking as it may sound, new research suggests they're developing just fine.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-did-all-those-african-penguins-die/av-59286725?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why did all those African penguins die?</a>
                <dd>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 15:05:00 GMT | It was a great mystery for conservationists in South Africa. At first, nobody had any clue what happened to a waddle of 65 African penguins found dead in Cape Town. And then they found the bee stings.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/safe-swimming-infidelity-and-a-correction/av-59264210?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Safe swimming, infidelity, and a correction</a>
                <dd>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 14:49:00 GMT | We love getting emails from you — and this episode's full of them. Got something to say? We're SU@dw.com
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-germany-will-wait-on-vaccinating-young-kids/av-59241624?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why Germany will wait on vaccinating young kids</a>
                <dd>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:26:00 GMT | The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine appears to be safe and extremely effective in 5-to-11-year-olds — even at low doses. But when can parents actually vaccinate them? Also, a look at an ongoing experiment involving dogs, an aging rock band and a whole lot of sweat.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-s-connection-to-political-violence/av-59216358?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19's connection to political violence</a>
                <dd>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:47:00 GMT | Do you know anyone who's become a bit more... politically agitated since the start of the pandemic? According to new research, it could be connected to pandemic psychology.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-monkeys-play-video-games-delaying-that-3rd-jab/av-59202989?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Monkeys play video games & delaying that 3rd jab</a>
                <dd>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 14:33:00 GMT | What can we learn from a bunch of rhesus macaques playing video games and 'choking' under the pressure? Also, it may be better for all of us if you don't get a 3rd jab any time soon, and a deep dive into the experiment that potty-trained cows.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-cows/av-59193234?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID & cows</a>
                <dd>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 21:00:00 GMT | COVID-19 booster shots work really well, but public health officials from around the world are saying most people shouldn't get one. Also, why did scientists in Germany teach cows to urinate in one spot only?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/have-you-ever-choked-under-pressure/av-59181712?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Have you ever 'choked' under pressure?</a>
                <dd>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 14:23:00 GMT | Just a tiny bit of psychological stress — and something you've been good at for as long as you can remember... becomes nearly impossible. Why?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-social-mindfulness/av-59136041?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Social mindfulness</a>
                <dd>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 11:50:00 GMT | Are you the kind of person who takes the last piece of cake? Or would you leave it there for someone else instead? Also, we take a look at your responses to the idea of a vaccine mandate.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/jabs-for-5-to-11-year-olds-pfizer-biontech-to-seek-approval-by-mid-october/av-59143564?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Jabs for 5-to-11-year-olds — Pfizer-BioNTech to seek approval by 'mid-October'</a>
                <dd>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 11:16:00 GMT | BioNTech's co-founders have said that an application to vaccinate 5-to-11-year-olds will be submitted to health agencies around the world "in the coming weeks" — and that the data from those trials "looks good." In the same interview with Der Spiegel, the CEO of BioNTech said Germany has "60 days to avoid a harsh winter."
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/do-you-use-your-turn-signal-while-driving/av-59126419?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Do you use your turn signal while driving?</a>
                <dd>Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:40:00 GMT | It's a pretty easy question. Where it starts to get interesting is when you ask yourself why.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-vaccine-mandates-your-emails/av-59101228?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19 vaccine mandates — your emails</a>
