                <dd>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 13:18:00 GMT | Is it fair to say you've been outraged by some of the risky things you've seen people doing during this pandemic? And is it also fair to say that maybe (just maybe) your assessment of how risky those things were.... was very, very biased? Also, why are so many of us so anxious about life going back to normal?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-don-t-i-want-the-pandemic-to-end/av-58036574?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why don't I want the pandemic to end?</a>
                <dd>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 15:06:00 GMT | No, you're not alone. As the world re-opens, hundreds of millions of people are feeling completely overwhelmed at the idea of 'going back to the way things were before.' This feeling (which is absolutely normal) is called 'reentry anxiety.' And there are concrete things you can do to make it go away.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/90-of-covid-19-cases-in-the-eu-will-be-delta-variant-by-end-of-august/av-58016356?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">90% of COVID-19 cases in the EU will be delta variant by 'end of August'</a>
                <dd>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 13:30:00 GMT | Nine out of 10 new infections. That's how dominant the delta variant is set to become in the EU within 10 weeks, says the ECDC. That has dramatic consequences for Europe's vaccine campaign.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-to-talk-to-someone-who-won-t-vaccinate-against-covid-19-your-emails/av-57956277?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">How to talk to someone who won't vaccinate against COVID-19 — your emails</a>
                <dd>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 05:05:00 GMT | A ruined wedding, an ugly scene in a coffee shop, a letter to a local newspaper. Listeners from all over the world have had a terrible time navigating our post-vaccinated world. Their stories get us closer to the actual problem.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-risky-places-a-toxic-claim-about-spike-proteins/av-57957401?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19: Risky places & a 'toxic' claim about spike proteins</a>
                <dd>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 15:06:00 GMT | Is it riskier to play a football game outside, or to meet one-on-one with a colleague inside? (Note: Your answer will say a lot more about your morality than you think.) Also, why is a professor of virology falsely claiming that spike proteins from vaccines are toxic?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-covid-19-aging-brains-very-cold-computers/av-57923935?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — COVID-19, aging brains & very cold computers</a>
                <dd>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 14:44:00 GMT | Will mutations change our vaccination strategy? Also, a controversial step in the fight against Alzheimer's, and how to tell a six-year-old what a quantum computer is.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-s-the-deal-with-aduhelm/av-57906892?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">What's the deal with Aduhelm?</a>
                <dd>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:42:00 GMT | It's a 'breakthrough' drug for Alzheimer's… but no one's sure if it actually works. There are also clear risks of side effects... and yet it was approved by the top US drug agency (prompting three scientists to quit). What is going on?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-a-quantum-computer-exactly/av-57882940?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">What is a quantum computer, exactly?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 12:54:00 GMT | They look weird, they're outrageously cold, and they're "stupider" than your smartphone. So why are governments throwing billions at quantum computers? And is it possible for a normal person to even understand them?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-delta-variant-danger-magnetic-misinformation/av-57855013?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19: Delta variant danger & 'magnetic' misinformation</a>
                <dd>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 13:04:00 GMT | How concerned do we have to be about the rapidly spreading Delta variant? (And why are they calling it 'Delta' anyway?) Also, what's with the TikTok videos where metal objects are sticking to vaccinated arms?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-dealing-with-the-hesitant-vaccine-mixing-and-super-mice/av-57840221?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Dealing with the hesitant, vaccine mixing, and super mice</a>
                <dd>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 09:53:00 GMT | If you don't vaccinate, you will get COVID-19 at some point. That's a fact. There's also the social argument. But a lot of people in the world remain against immunization. How do we deal with these people - especially if they are close to us? Also, would you like to live a longer, more healthy life?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-do-i-talk-to-someone-who-won-t-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19/av-57832104?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">How do I talk to someone who won't get vaccinated against COVID-19?</a>
                <dd>Wed, 9 Jun 2021 15:33:00 GMT | It can be really, really frustrating to talk to someone who's misinformed and doesn't plan to get vaccinated. And sometimes, the easiest thing to do is just avoid the topic entirely. But what if it's a friend, a colleague or a family member we care about?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-mixing-doses-boosters-a-warning-for-the-unvaccinated/av-57819555?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19: Mixing doses, boosters & a warning for the unvaccinated</a>
                <dd>Tue, 8 Jun 2021 16:57:00 GMT | Can you get more than one kind of COVID-19 vaccine? When will we need a booster shot? And what is inevitably going to happen to those who have chosen not to vaccinate?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/do-you-want-to-live-a-longer-more-energetic-life/av-57780869?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Do you want to live a longer, more energetic life?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 4 Jun 2021 12:52:00 GMT | The march of time is unrelenting. Sure. But scientists say they're on the cusp of changing how long we live – and HOW WELL we live those bonus years.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-sleep-covid-19-a-strange-sounding-ostrich/av-57743106?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Sleep, COVID-19 & a strange-sounding ostrich</a>
                <dd>Tue, 1 Jun 2021 13:29:00 GMT | If your genes make you a "night owl," the odds are higher you'll develop depression. Can we do anything to change that? Also, why is the EU planning to store our vaccination information inside a QR code, of all places? And, finally, a big shout-out to the listener who won our bird quiz!
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/herd-immunity-why-crosswords-or-sudoku-don-t-help-your-brain/av-57731020?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Herd immunity & why crosswords or sudoku don't help your brain</a>
                <dd>Mon, 31 May 2021 15:17:00 GMT | Know someone who does puzzles to "keep their brain sharp"? We've got bad news for them. Also, it's time to forget herd immunity and embrace the idea of booster shots.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-will-covid-19-passports-work/av-57701029?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">How will 'COVID-19 passports' work?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 28 May 2021 12:00:00 GMT | In a month or so, EU citizens are supposed to get a "digital COVID-19 vaccine passport" which they will be able to use to travel. But what will it actually look like? Where will this (private) health data be stored? Who has access to it? And could it be hacked?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/your-answers-to-the-bird-quiz/av-57675169?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">YOUR ANSWERS to the bird quiz</a>
                <dd>Wed, 26 May 2021 15:21:00 GMT | Seven birdcalls. That was the challenge we put to you just over a week ago. And now, it's time for a reckoning.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-black-fungus-pregnant-women-the-closing-time-effect/av-57659754?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Black fungus, pregnant women & the closing time effect</a>
                <dd>Tue, 25 May 2021 15:05:00 GMT | What is "black fungus," and how is it related to COVID-19? What are the arguments for — or against — vaccinating pregnant women? And why do people think they're more attractive right before a bar closes?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/should-pregnant-women-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19/av-57585504?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Should pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19?</a>
                <dd>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:14:00 GMT | More than 100,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated against COVID-19. What does the data show?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-birds-babies-covid-19/av-57569419?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Birds, babies & COVID-19</a>
                <dd>Tue, 18 May 2021 13:21:00 GMT | Have an ear for birdsong? Neither do we. But with a couple clues (and a digital tool), we think you can solve our bird quiz. Also, some new fertility data shows some pretty wild differences between countries, and three big updates on major COVID-19 vaccines.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-vaccine-updates-getting-pregnant/av-57559357?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19: Vaccine updates & getting pregnant</a>
                <dd>Mon, 17 May 2021 14:55:00 GMT | Some surprisingly positive news about China's CoronaVac, a formal complaint against Russia's Sputnik V, and Germany bucks the baby trend.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-bird-was-that/av-57533662?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">What bird was that?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 14 May 2021 14:24:00 GMT | Chirp, chirp. It's time to relax. So kick off your shoes, put your feet up, lean back and just enjoy the birdsong. And if you recognize a few of the calls in our quiz, please take a second and send your answers to su@dw.com.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-flourishing-the-undecided/av-57495869?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Flourishing & the undecided</a>
                <dd>Tue, 11 May 2021 13:08:00 GMT | The more people who vaccinate, the quicker life goes back to normal. But is there a (proven) way to convince the "on the fence" crowd to go get jabbed? Also, once life does get back to normal, how do I get back to normal — and maybe even start growing again?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/how-do-we-start-feeling-good-again/av-57483334?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">How do we start feeling good again?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 10 May 2021 10:23:00 GMT | COVID-19 vaccination rates are going up. Spring birds (at least here in the northern hemisphere) are chirping an end to the winter of Corona. But research says we might need help recalling how to feel happiness and live fulfilling lives. Here are a few thoughts on how to start flourishing.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/3-quick-ways-to-get-more-people-to-vaccinate-against-covid-19/av-57465314?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">3 quick ways to get more people to vaccinate against COVID-19</a>
                <dd>Fri, 7 May 2021 14:43:00 GMT | Will countries actually reach herd immunity? It's an open question. But studies have shown that there are a few "tricks" to get people to immunize — even if they've already decided not to.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/violent-religious-scripture-leads-to-increased-support-for-deadly-violence/av-57451569?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Violent religious scripture leads to increased support for deadly violence</a>
                <dd>Thu, 6 May 2021 16:22:00 GMT | "A life for a life, an eye for an eye." There's a tendency to downplay, or even willfully ignore, some of the most blatant, barbaric language that's tucked inside the holy books of Christians, Muslims and Jews. But a novel experiment shows that these outdated verses, when quoted to believers, cause real-world harm today.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-breastfeeding-happiness-bad-drinking/av-57426670?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup —Breastfeeding, happiness & bad drinking</a>
                <dd>Tue, 4 May 2021 16:12:00 GMT | From a risk/reward standpoint, does it make sense to fly to another country to get vaccinated there? Also, is it OK to breastfeed if you have COVID-19 but don't know it yet? Or if you just got vaccinated? Finally, human happiness takes a hit, and Twitter users hit the bottle a bit too hard.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/people-rate-themselves-as-more-attractive-at-closing-time-even-sober/av-57611498?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">People rate themselves as more attractive at closing time — even sober</a>
                <dd>Sat, 1 May 2021 05:05:00 GMT | The later it gets at a bar or pub, the more likely it is you'll meet someone who thinks they're pretty hot stuff. Oddly, though, a new study suggests this "closing time" effect has nothing to do with alcohol. So what is going on?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/tweets-about-blackout-drinking-doubled-during-lockdown/av-57392356?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Tweets about 'blackout' drinking doubled during lockdown</a>
                <dd>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 15:05:00 GMT | One more beer? Or an extra glass of wine? Sure. It's a pandemic. But drinking to the point of blackout — entirely ON YOUR OWN — really is a problem. And if previous pandemics are any clue, what happens during lockdown doesn't stay there.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/people-get-unhappier-not-happier-as-they-get-older/av-57379930?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">People get unhappier (not happier) as they get older</a>
                <dd>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:27:00 GMT | Researchers in Germany have disproven the idea that happiness is 'u-shaped' — saying the data clearly shows we're more likely to become unhappier over time. So... what on earth are we supposed to do with that information?
