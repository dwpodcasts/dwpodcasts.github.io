                <dd>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 13:57:00 GMT | The omicron numbers are already awful. Yet there's a case for cautious optimism based on what we've seen so far.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-the-omicron-lockdowns/av-60241676?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — the omicron lockdowns</a>
                <dd>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 04:05:00 GMT | Omicron won't be a wave, it'll be a wall, says Germany's top virologist. And the best response is to lock things down — again. Can people tolerate that?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/what-do-women-and-men-lie-about-on-social-media/av-60241663?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">What do women and men lie about on social media?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 04:05:00 GMT | If you're on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter, then surely you've seen some… less-than-truthful posts. But who's deceiving whom, exactly? And just what is it that they're lying about?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-cold-christmas-and-new-year/av-60231288?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">A cold Christmas (and New Year)</a>
                <dd>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:35:00 GMT | Omicron will mean tougher restrictions for a lot of countries around the world. How should we be dealing with that news?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/which-covid-19-booster-is-best-against-omicron/av-60215873?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Which COVID-19 booster is best against omicron?</a>
                <dd>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:25:00 GMT | Honest answer: It's too early to say. But a handful of small-scale, pre-print studies seem to be pointing in one direction.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-novavax-gets-european-approval/av-60199506?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID-19: Novavax gets European approval</a>
                <dd>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 15:29:00 GMT | Several months behind schedule, the Novavax protein subunit vaccine has been approved for use in Europe. This is potentially very important news for the fight against COVID-19. Why?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-winter-s-here/av-60167329?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Winter's here</a>
                <dd>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 04:00:00 GMT | How do I keep the holidays focused on mistletoe instead of misinformation? And how will the pandemic play out in 2022?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/covid-conspiracies-under-the-christmas-tree/av-60160006?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">COVID conspiracies under the Christmas tree</a>
                <dd>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 11:51:00 GMT | What if all you want for Christmas ... is for your family to feel like a family again?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/this-one-s-for-you/av-60134325?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">This one's for you</a>
                <dd>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 16:16:00 GMT | Our favorite (and not-so-favorite) YouTube comments and emails from SU listeners.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-are-omicron-hospitalizations-so-low/av-60120186?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why are omicron hospitalizations so low?</a>
                <dd>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:54:00 GMT | If omicron isn't 'milder' than delta, why are fewer people ending up in hospitals?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/omicron-what-this-wave-will-look-like/av-60105958?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Omicron: What this wave will look like</a>
                <dd>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:36:00 GMT | New models from the UK have given us a clear picture (almost to the day) of when the omicron curve will peak and flatten. The news is good and bad. Also, where do "natural immunity" and Novavax fit in?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-hopium-and-copium/av-60072434?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Hopium and copium</a>
                <dd>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 04:00:00 GMT | Be honest: Do you find it harder to care about omicron than the variants before it? Also, how much info can be learned from your voice?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/omicron-what-the-lab-results-can-tell-you/av-60083926?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Omicron: What the lab results can tell you</a>
                <dd>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 15:06:00 GMT | 'Fully vaccinated' just got a new definition.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-lab-full-of-mini-brains-with-eyes/av-60072459?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">The lab full of mini brains (with 'eyes')</a>
                <dd>Thu, 9 Dec 2021 16:41:00 GMT | If a free-floating brain could feel pain or 'wake up,' would we know? That question was important enough for us to travel to Düsseldorf, Germany.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-hole-in-your-face-that-s-leaking-data/av-60060325?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">The hole in your face that's leaking data</a>
                <dd>Wed, 8 Dec 2021 15:47:00 GMT | At this point we should know that our phones are listening to us. But it's not just our words that are giving our private data away. It's how we say them.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/milder-omicron-news-is-a-dangerous-distraction/av-60049074?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">'Milder omicron' news is a dangerous distraction</a>
                <dd>Tue, 7 Dec 2021 17:20:00 GMT | We all need a dose of positive pandemic news. But what if that makes us miss the far more alarming (and substantiated) data we have about this variant?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-where-are-we/av-60035743?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Where are we?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 6 Dec 2021 16:20:00 GMT | There was a LOT of news about the omicron variant last week. But which of it was actually important? Also, why are scientists in Germany growing thousands of miniature human brains with eyeballs on them?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/omicron-news-that-s-making-everyone-happy-today/av-59989797?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Omicron news that's making everyone happy today</a>
                <dd>Wed, 1 Dec 2021 16:39:00 GMT | How the tables turn. Today we look at two new omicron developments that feel a bit too euphoric.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/omicron-news-that-s-scaring-people-today/av-59980301?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Omicron news that's scaring people today</a>
                <dd>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:42:00 GMT | A look at 3 widely shared omicron developments that aren't as scary when you dig a little deeper.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/omicron-variant-what-we-don-t-know/av-59969825?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Omicron variant: What we (don't) know</a>
                <dd>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 15:23:00 GMT | The real-world data we have on omicron is skewed — in a lot of different ways.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-is-it-time/av-59948455?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — Is it time?</a>
                <dd>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 04:00:00 GMT | Forcing people to vaccinate is not an appealing option — at all. It might happen anyway.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-vaccine-mandate-for-all-germans/av-59921876?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">A vaccine mandate for all Germans?</a>
                <dd>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:27:00 GMT | Should the German government force citizens to vaccinate against the coronavirus? You can learn a lot by asking people on the streets.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-test-that-birds-can-beat-kids-at/av-59910491?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">The test that birds can beat kids at</a>
                <dd>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:25:00 GMT | How do you explain the concept of time to a bird? And why would they ever need to delay gratification?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-the-wrong-kind-of-quiet/av-59883794?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup — (The wrong kind of quiet)</a>
                <dd>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 04:05:00 GMT | What would it be like if birds just... didn't sing as much? Step outside and find out. Also, if you haven't met many atheists out there, maybe it's because they're scared to tell you?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-vaccine-mandate-for-all-austrians/av-59882388?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">A vaccine mandate for all Austrians</a>
                <dd>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 15:26:00 GMT | With the 'pandemic of the unvaccinated' overwhelming European hospitals and forcing lockdowns, there's a difficult question in the air: Does your right to make a personal medical choice allow you to directly take away other people's freedoms?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-it-so-hard-to-come-out-as-atheist/av-59839257?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why is it so hard to come out as atheist?</a>
                <dd>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 17:48:00 GMT | "Not believing in god" just feels kind of... ugly. Or socially dangerous. Why is that?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/do-you-care-about-birds/av-59829059?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Do you care about birds?</a>
                <dd>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 17:12:00 GMT | It's a callous question to ask. But with new evidence showing a stark decline in bird numbers, it's worth trying to answer.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weekly-roundup-believe-it/av-59805680?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Weekly roundup: Believe it</a>
                <dd>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 04:05:00 GMT | Yes, there really are two different pills you'll be able to take soon if you catch the coronavirus. Also, a new study shows that science deniers in various countries tend to have something in common.
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-don-t-people-trust-science/av-59799984?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Why don't people trust science?</a>
                <dd>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 15:19:00 GMT | We really do live in a world where a decent amount of people just... don't believe in facts. Who — and where — are they? And what could have possibly 'made' them into that kind of person?
            
                <dt><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/did-christmas-just-get-canceled/av-59794262?maca=en-podcast_spectrum-31485-xml-mrss">Did Christmas just get canceled?</a>
                <dd>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:00:00 GMT | More than 50,000 new daily infections — an incidence of 250 — and a holiday season just kicking off. What is going on in Germany?
