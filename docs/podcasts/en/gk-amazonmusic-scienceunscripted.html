                <dd>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 12:54:00 GMT | They look weird, they're outrageously cold, and they're "stupider" than your smartphone. So why are governments throwing billions at quantum computers? And is it possible for a normal person to even understand them?

                <dd>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 09:53:00 GMT | If you don't vaccinate, you will get COVID-19 at some point. That's a fact. There's also the social argument. But a lot of people in the world remain against immunization. How do we deal with these people - especially if they are close to us? Also, would you like to live a longer, more healthy life?

                <dd>Wed, 9 Jun 2021 15:33:00 GMT | It can be really, really frustrating to talk to someone who's misinformed and doesn't plan to get vaccinated. And sometimes, the easiest thing to do is just avoid the topic entirely. But what if it's a friend, a colleague or a family member we care about?
