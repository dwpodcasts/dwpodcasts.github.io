                <dd>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 15:30:00 GMT | In Cameroon, global wheat woes are forcing the African nation to rethink the way it farms. Meanwhile in Argentina, a new genetically modified wheat variety claims to withstand climate extremes. And, in Ghana, farmers are ditching local seed breeds for foreign varieties — but why? Plus — how we can fight antimicrobial resistance.

And try as you might, dressing, speaking and existing that way just didn’t feel right — in fact, it felt wrong. Millions of people share this struggle worldwide, and for those living in Iran, the fight for transgender equality is shaped by the country’s determination to prevent same-sex relationships.

Russians in opposition to President Vladimir Putin have fled the country in fear of repression. And in neighboring Belarus, Putin's ally Alexander Lukashenko is clamping down on Belarusian language and heritage. Many were arrested and their books destroyed.

Many civil servants are well past 70, sometimes even over 100 years old. They hold on to their jobs and their salaries. In Japan, some seniors also choose to continue working part-time jobs – to boost their pensions and because they believe it helps stave off dementia.

That's what a remote region in India is grappling with. And mobile teams in Kenya with a more hands-on approach want to help those who weren't able to get any formal schooling in rurual areas in the country's north.

Dealing with the remnants of slavery is still an issue, even today. We visit Mount Vernon, home to first president George Washington, who held slaves! We also talk about today's ongoing racial profiling. The US Justice Department has just launched an investigation into Louisiana State Police.
