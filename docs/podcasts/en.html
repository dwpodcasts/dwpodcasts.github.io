                <dd>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 07:24:05 GMT <p>
On the Green Fence lives up to its name in looking at complex, often
divisive environmental issues from multiple angles. It’s not about
greenism, but about delving into the major concerns of our time in an
engaging and human way. DW reporter Neil King sits on the fence and
explores the role business, society and science play in our transition
to a more environmentally friendly world. In so doing, he aims to make
sense of issues that affect us all, but which are often over-
simplified or convoluted by ideology and lobbyism. On the Green Fence
stands for an open-minded, relevant and entertaining approach to the
environment.
