    delivers a performance full of contrasts and surprises in ''Variations on a Children''s
    Song'' by Erno Dohnanyi.Erno Dohnanyi

    Variations on a children''s song for piano and orchestra, op. 25

    MP3 recorded at the University of Bonn on October 3, 2011 by Deutsche Welle (DW)


    The 2011 Beethovenfest celebrated Franz Liszt and the music of Hungary, the composer''s
    home country - reason enough to invite Budapest''s young and spirited Dohnanyi
    Orchestra Budafok.

    The ensemble was also invited to celebrate German Unity Day on October 3 and the
    key role Hungary played in ultimately bringing down the Iron Curtain. Beginning
    in late spring of 1989, Hungarian reformers and activists began taking apart their
    country''s fortified border with Austria. Their actions resulted in the first
    breach of the fortifications separating eastern and western Europe, helping set
    the stage for the peaceful revolutions in Germany and other countries months later.


    "That is really a matter of pride for us because we had the courage to bring about
    change, but none of us expected that so much would happen so fast!" conductor
    Gabor Hollerung said.


    The October 3 program paid special tribute to the music of Hollerung''s homeland,
    including a work written by his orchestra''s namesake, composer Erno Dohnanyi.
    The second part of the group''s name, Budafok, stems from the Budapest district
    Budafok-Teteny, which helped support the establishment of the orchestra.


    Dohnanyi''s temperamental "Variations on a Children''s Song" is a bit like the
    changing tides of history as it shifts among moods, from bright, playful - even
    banal - to dramatic and mysterious. The work imitates or cites a hodge-podge of
    compositions, including Kodaly''s "Viennese Musical Clock," Beethoven''s Piano
    Concerto No. 3 and the central melody in the work, "Twinkle, twinkle, little star."


    Listen as pianist Jeno Jando masterfully brings each variation to life in this
    Beethovenfest performance.

    September 24, 2011 turned into a long night for the Roma and Sinti Philharmonic.
    This special project formed of professional musicians of Roma and Sinti heritage
    gave two concerts nearly back to back at the Beethovenfest''s "Liszt Night" celebrating
    that composer and the contemporary expression of his Hungarian musical heritage.


    After midnight and many encores and curtain calls, a clarinetist takes things
    into his own hands here, heading to the front of the stage with a tune on his
    lips. It doesn''t take long for some of his fellow musicians to jump up and join
    him in this rollicking improvisation on gypsy folk themes - just the thing to
    send the crowd happily on their way.

    The Roma and Sinti Philharmonic draws musicians of Roma and Sinti heritage from
    across Europe together to celebrate their culture''s influence on music from folk
    to classical. This recording is a fine example of that.


    Violinist Geza Hosszu-Legocky has performed as part of the Roma and Sinti orchestral
    project in the past, also stealing the show as a soloist. The fleet-fingered 26-year-old
    said that playing violin has been in his family for generations, with his grandfather
    having been a big influence on his performance style.


    Hosszu-Legocky is joined here by cellist Rodin Moldovan for a passacaglia on a
    theme by Handel, penned in 1893 by Norwegian composer Johan Halvorsen. It''s a
    piece at once melancholy and gentle but full of fire, especially as the instrumentalists
    charge toward the work''s somber close.

    Encore pieces reveal much of the mood of the moment. Such is the case with this
    one. After Mihaela Ursuleasa''s performance of Liszt''s Piano Concerto No. 1 with
    the Roma and Sinti Philharmonic, the audience simply wasn''t ready to let her
    go, so the pianist wowed the audience for a second time with her rendition of
    this toccata by 20th century Romanian composer Paul Constantinescu.


    It''s a perfect piece to round out an evening or an album, as it does on Ursuleasa''s
    2009 solo debut titled "Piano &amp; Forte." Constantinescu''s composition requires
    not only dexterous fingers but also the ability to combine speedy, virtuousic
    playing with much sensitivity.


    The classical pianist may have acquired her knack for showmanship from her father,
    a Romanian gypsy who made a living playing folk music. Conductor Riccardo Sahiti
    praises her as being among a handful of the best soloists with whom he has worked.

    \ (DW)\n \nImprovisation has been called the well-spring of all music. In the\
    \ baroque and classical periods, it was standard practice. The improvisational\
    \ abilities of composers like Bach, Handel and Mozart were legendary. Beethoven\
    \ also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano. Many of his piano\
    \ sonatas, although precisely crafted compositions, reflect the freewheeling spirit\
    \ of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions\
    \ of chords.\n \nToday, the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare\
    \ within the realm of \"classical\" or \"serious\" music - with one exception\
    \ being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn\
    \ tunes. However, a talent of the caliber of Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero\
    \ is extremely rare. Montero, who says that she began improvising at age five,\
    \ has been asked repeatedly \"how she does it,\" for which she has no answer.\
    \ \n \nTo demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention, Montero often\
    \ begins a recital playing works from the repertory, but in the second half, improvises\
    \ elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members. The styles\
    \ and rhythms can vary from Romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango.\n\
    \ \nWe've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the Petersberg\
    \ Hotel near Bonn. She begins by plucking out the melody of the song \"Guantanamera\"\
    \ and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song's\
    \ motifs. Experiencing Gabriela Montero live in concert reminds one of the fact\
    \ that without improvisation, there would be no music.\n \nAuthor: Rick FulkerEditor:\
