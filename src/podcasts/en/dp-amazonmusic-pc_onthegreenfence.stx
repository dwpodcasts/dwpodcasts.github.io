  summary: Buying a family home is a major life milestone in many countries. But a
    lack of affordable housing and a desire to curb carbon footprints has led to the
    rise of alternative forms of accommodation, including "co-housing." Just how does
    this model work? And how difficult is it to get people to share their living space?

  summary: The average living space in western countries has increased dramatically
    over the past decades. In Germany, urban sprawl and construction projects are
    eating away at nature at a rate of 50 soccer pitches per day. At the same time,
    people here are struggling to find affordable accommodation. How can we break
    this trend and are tiny houses really the answer?

  summary: Climate change is expected to make heat waves longer and more severe, with
    catastrophic consequences for our health and economies. The International Energy
    Agency predicts that energy demand from air conditioners will triple by 2050.
    But ironically, the more we use these carbon-intensive machines, the more we contribute
    to global heating. So how do we break that cycle?

  summary: In Germany, nearly 40% of national greenhouse gas emissions are caused
    by buildings. The housing and construction sector will need to change dramatically
    if there is to be any hope of achieving climate neutrality by 2045. But where
    to start? Listen in to find out more about passive houses, sustainable construction
    materials and the carbon footprint of building a family home from scratch.

  summary: Three months after deadly flash floods tore through Germany's Ahr Valley,
    residents in the village of Dernau are looking to the future. For many, that means
    rebuilding homes destroyed in the deluge. But how do you build back in a sustainable

  summary: Climate change and severe droughts have weakened forests around the globe.
    In Germany, where many forests are planted monocultures, about 80% of trees are
    considered unhealthy. What's even more alarming is that the forest dieback is

  summary: British social psychologist Steve Reicher believes that all social change
    happens through the collective. Human beings all over the planet endured a serious
    infringement of their private rights when governments made the decision to lock
    down amid the COVID-19 crisis. For the most part, there was consensus that this
    tough decision was correct. But how was that consensus established?

    believes that question is at the heart of the climate change conundrum. When the
    coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, the response by governments was

  title: Not having children to save the planet

---
On the Green Fence lives up to its name in looking at complex, often
divisive environmental issues from multiple angles. It’s not about
greenism, but about delving into the major concerns of our time in an
engaging and human way. DW reporter Neil King sits on the fence and
explores the role business, society and science play in our transition
to a more environmentally friendly world. In so doing, he aims to make
sense of issues that affect us all, but which are often over-
simplified or convoluted by ideology and lobbyism. On the Green Fence
stands for an open-minded, relevant and entertaining approach to the
environment.
