  summary: Outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel really is going to step off that dance
    floor soon. What better way to end a podcast dedicated to her last dance, i.e.her
    last year in office, than with a rare exclusive interview? DW's Max Hofmann waltzed
    the German chancellor through the interview and has the backstory for us in this
    final episode of "Merkel's last dance."

  summary: The beginning of the end of the Merkel era is here. A narrow win for the
    SPD under Olaf Scholz has left Merkel's camp damaged, and given unprecedented
    leverage to the "kingmakers," the neoliberal FDP and Greens, in the search for
    a new coalition. In the latest edition of Merkel's Last Dance we catch up on the
    state of play and speak to potential FDP Foreign Minister, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff.
