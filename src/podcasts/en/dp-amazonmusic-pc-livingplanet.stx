  summary: "We live on a watery planet \u2014 nearly three-quarters of the Earth's\
    \ surface is underwater. As climate change raises temperatures, water is being\
    \ pushed in new and more extreme directions. But are there ways we could use water\

  summary: This week, we bring you an episode of DW's On the Green Fence, hosted by
    Neil King. In it, he heads to the forest in search of urgent answers on how to
    save them. Around the globe, climate change and severe droughts have wrought havoc
    on forests far and wide. As forest dieback increases, even young trees are dying.
    So what happens if we lose our forests? And what we can do to stop it?

  summary: How should we construct our houses and cities to better withstand a changing
    climate? This week we explore building strategies that reduce emissions and deal
    with new climate realities. From the promise of hydrogen fueling neighborhoods
    and businesses, to towns and cities that are using flooding to their advantage,
    we dig into how we can better design the places we live.

    animals and humans, we dig into ways that climate change is transforming more
    than just the weather. We also take a look at one tight-lipped contributor to

    in check at the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Young people especially are
    piling on the pressure for action. We hear from DW reporters covering the event

    sacred sites. And in Sierra Leone, an expensive, internationally-funded industrial
    fishing habor could ruin residents' livelihoods and the local ecosystem.

    people from Russia to Saudi Arabia to the US. But oil is a leading contributor
    to climate change and can lead to leaks and spills that pollute waterways and
    ecosystems. As the world gets more serious about shifting away from fossil fuels,
