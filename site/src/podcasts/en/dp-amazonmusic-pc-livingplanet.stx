  summary: "We live on a watery planet \u2014 nearly three-quarters of the Earth's\
    \ surface is underwater. As climate change raises temperatures, water is being\
    \ pushed in new and more extreme directions. But are there ways we could use water\
    \ to our advantage, environmentally? This week, we hear from communities trying\
    \ to push back the seas and others suffering from diminishing water supplies."

  summary: This week, we bring you an episode of DW's On the Green Fence, hosted by
    Neil King. In it, he heads to the forest in search of urgent answers on how to
    save them. Around the globe, climate change and severe droughts have wrought havoc
    on forests far and wide. As forest dieback increases, even young trees are dying.
    So what happens if we lose our forests? And what we can do to stop it?

  summary: How should we construct our houses and cities to better withstand a changing
    climate? This week we explore building strategies that reduce emissions and deal
    with new climate realities. From the promise of hydrogen fueling neighborhoods
    and businesses, to towns and cities that are using flooding to their advantage,
    we dig into how we can better design the places we live.
