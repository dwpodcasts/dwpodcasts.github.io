  summary: Is it fair to say you've been outraged by some of the risky things you've
    seen people doing during this pandemic? And is it also fair to say that maybe
    (just maybe) your assessment of how risky those things were.... was very, very
    biased? Also, why are so many of us so anxious about life going back to normal?

  summary: No, you're not alone. As the world re-opens, hundreds of millions of people
    are feeling completely overwhelmed at the idea of 'going back to the way things

    And there are concrete things you can do to make it go away.
