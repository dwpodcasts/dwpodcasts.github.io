  summary: Rising waters in 17 lakes in Kenya - including Lake Baringo and Lake Bogoria
    - are displacing people and upending ways of life. Not to mention, it's stressing
    out wildlife like giraffes that have been stuck on a newly created island by the
    high waters. In this feature, we look at how people and animals are coping in
    the East African Rift Valley.

    with symbols of cultural importance. We venture to the spot in Italy where marble
    for Michelangelo's sculptures once came from. Controversy is also stirring on
    some mountains in Greece, as wind turbines anger locals. And we hear from a journalist

    habitats. In Cameroon, the Baka people are being driven out of their forests by
    logging and mining. In the US, a new lithium mine threatens to infringe on Indigenous
    sacred sites. And in Sierra Leone, an expensive, internationally-funded industrial
    fishing habor could ruin residents' livelihoods and the local ecosystem.

  summary: Oil is big business. It's an industry that employs an estimated 6 million
    people from Russia to Saudi Arabia to the US. But oil is a leading contributor
    to climate change and can lead to leaks and spills that pollute waterways and
    ecosystems. As the world gets more serious about shifting away from fossil fuels,
    the future for oil looks tenuous.
