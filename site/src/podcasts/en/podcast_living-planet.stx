  summary: Oil is big business. It's an industry that employs an estimated 6 million
    people from Russia to Saudi Arabia to the US. But oil is a leading contributor
    to climate change and can lead to leaks and spills that pollute waterways and
    ecosystems. As the world gets more serious about shifting away from fossil fuels,
    the future for oil looks tenuous.
