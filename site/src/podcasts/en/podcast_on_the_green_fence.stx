  summary: "Germany's new agriculture minister Cem \xD6zdemir has caused a stir after\
    \ speaking out against junk prices in supermarkets, especially for meat - the\
    \ biggest driver of food-related greenhouse gas emissions. But why is this so\
    \ problematic in Germany and would higher meat prices really solve the problem?"

  summary: Buying a family home is a major life milestone in many countries. But a
    lack of affordable housing and a desire to curb carbon footprints has led to the
    rise of alternative forms of accommodation, including "co-housing." Just how does
    this model work? And how difficult is it to get people to share their living space?

  summary: The average living space in western countries has increased dramatically
    over the past decades. In Germany, urban sprawl and construction projects are
    eating away at nature at a rate of 50 soccer pitches per day. At the same time,
    people here are struggling to find affordable accommodation. How can we break
    this trend and are tiny houses really the answer?

  summary: Climate change is expected to make heat waves longer and more severe, with
    catastrophic consequences for our health and economies. The International Energy
    Agency predicts that energy demand from air conditioners will triple by 2050.
    But ironically, the more we use these carbon-intensive machines, the more we contribute
    to global heating. So how do we break that cycle?

  summary: In Germany, nearly 40% of national greenhouse gas emissions are caused
    by buildings. The housing and construction sector will need to change dramatically
    if there is to be any hope of achieving climate neutrality by 2045. But where
    to start? Listen in to find out more about passive houses, sustainable construction
    materials and the carbon footprint of building a family home from scratch.

  summary: Three months after deadly flash floods tore through Germany's Ahr Valley,
    residents in the village of Dernau are looking to the future. For many, that means
    rebuilding homes destroyed in the deluge. But how do you build back in a sustainable
    way? What needs to change to make buildings more flood-resilient? And when does
    it make sense to move away altogether?

    \ issues had never really played a role for brothers Adnan and Burak Arslan. But\
    \ when Adnan was selected to be a part of a citizens' assembly on climate change,\

  summary: Climate change and severe droughts have weakened forests around the globe.
    In Germany, where many forests are planted monocultures, about 80% of trees are
    considered unhealthy. What's even more alarming is that the forest dieback is
    also affecting younger trees now. So what happens if we lose our forests? And
    is there anything we can do to stop it?

  summary: Germany's demographic setup favors the older generation in this year's
    crunch election. More than half the eligible voters are above the age of 50 and
    only 15% are below the age of 30. What does this mean for intergenerational dialogue
    and future environmental policy? Are older people in Germany really less interested
    in the environment than the Friday For Futures generation?

  summary: "This week, On the Green Fence brings you another environment podcast we\
    \ think you'll enjoy: Fireline. Wildfires across the United States are getting\
    \ bigger, hotter and more devastating. But what does all this fire really mean\

    \ Aachen-based engineering professor G\xFCnther Schuh believes he can carve out\
    \ a space for his electric car startup: e.Go Mobile. He says his small e-vehicles\

  summary: Most urban centers around the world are designed for cars, with significant
    chunks of space dedicated to roads and parking spaces. But what if our infrastructure
    was geared towards pedestrians and cyclists instead? Advocates say shifting away
    from car-centric cities could bring huge benefits to our health and climate.

  summary: Lithium is a critical component of e-car batteries. As demand for electric
    cars soars, this raw material could be heading for severe bottlenecks very soon
    if lithium production isn't ramped up dramatically. But what does this mean for
    the environment and just how far can we get with the 86 million tons of lithium
    resources currently identified globally?

  summary: If Germany wants to meet its target of getting 10 million electric cars
    on the road by the end of the decade, the country's car industry needs to change
    gears fast. Faced with ever stricter EU regulation and CO2 limits, Volkswagen
    Group has announced plans to roll out 70% of the core brand in Europe as e-cars
    by 2030. But just how sustainable is their new e-car strategy?

  summary: "There are 1.5 billion cars in the world today. These combustion engine\
    \ vehicles are major polluters, and governments are hoping to meet their climate\
    \ targets by replacing them with lower-emission alternatives, such as electric\

  summary: Humans have long been driven by a desire to explore the planet and visit
    faraway places. But with tourism's toll on the environment now calling our globetrotting
    habits into question, some say it's time for change. But just how realistic is
    this given that people are itching to travel freely again once the Covid-19 pandemic
    is over?

  summary: The iconic cove from "The Beach" movie is slowly starting to recover from
    the onslaught of mass tourism. Thai authorities had sealed it off to the public
    in 2018 after almost all the coral was destroyed. Now tourism operators and local
    stakeholders struggling under the pandemic are urging the authorities to reopen
    the beach. But how can the environmental recovery be secured if this happens?

On the Green Fence lives up to its name in looking at complex, often
divisive environmental issues from multiple angles. It’s not about
greenism, but about delving into the major concerns of our time in an
engaging and human way. DW reporter Neil King sits on the fence and
explores the role business, society and science play in our transition
to a more environmentally friendly world. In so doing, he aims to make
sense of issues that affect us all, but which are often over-
simplified or convoluted by ideology and lobbyism. On the Green Fence
stands for an open-minded, relevant and entertaining approach to the
environment.
