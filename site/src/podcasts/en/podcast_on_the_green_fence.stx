  summary: If Germany wants to meet its target of getting 10 million electric cars
    on the road by the end of the decade, the country's car industry needs to change
    gears fast. Faced with ever stricter EU regulation and CO2 limits, Volkswagen
    Group has announced plans to roll out 70% of the core brand in Europe as e-cars
    by 2030. But just how sustainable is their new e-car strategy?

  summary: "There are 1.5 billion cars in the world today. These combustion engine\
    \ vehicles are major polluters, and governments are hoping to meet their climate\
    \ targets by replacing them with lower-emission alternatives, such as electric\
    \ cars. But this transformation is going to be a massive challenge, and it's already\
    \ proving to be extremely divisive in Germany \u2014 one of the world's leading\
    \ car producers."

  summary: Humans have long been driven by a desire to explore the planet and visit
    faraway places. But with tourism's toll on the environment now calling our globetrotting
    habits into question, some say it's time for change. But just how realistic is
    this given that people are itching to travel freely again once the Covid-19 pandemic
    is over?

  summary: The iconic cove from "The Beach" movie is slowly starting to recover from
    the onslaught of mass tourism. Thai authorities had sealed it off to the public
    in 2018 after almost all the coral was destroyed. Now tourism operators and local
    stakeholders struggling under the pandemic are urging the authorities to reopen
    the beach. But how can the environmental recovery be secured if this happens?

  summary: Flying is one of the most polluting and privileged forms of travel. The
    aviation industry is facing growing pressure to wean itself off fossil fuels to
    bring down CO2 emissions. Can it succeed? Or do we need to stop flying altogether?

  summary: Cruises are among the most carbon-intensive ways to travel, and the sector
    is growing fast. Cruise ships are also a testing ground for new technologies and
    alternative fuels, and could help drive change in the shipping industry as a whole.

    is planning to meet its target of going climate neutral by 2050.

  summary: Global meat production is predicted to grow 85% by 2050. If this happens,
    it will have a cataclysmic effect on the environment. So how are we going to feed
    10 billion people - who desire meat - without using more land and increasing atmospheric
    emissions? The answer to this question will have to include meat alternatives.
    But which ones have a chance? And what's standing in the way?

  summary: "Locally hunted game has the smallest environmental footprint of all meat.\
    \ The downsides of factory farming don\u2019t apply to animals roaming free in\

  summary: As the proverb goes, man is at the top of the food chain. Does that give
    us the right to kill animals? Rainer Hagencord, a vegetarian priest located in
    the Silicon Valley of German meat production, preaches against this. His exegesis
    of the Bible is plunging devout Christians into existential crisis. Some are leaving
    the church. Others welcome him as a prophetic voice the region deeply needs.

  summary: Germany's meat industry slaughters over 750 million animals per year, with
    dire consequences for the environment. After Neil and Gabe's requests to visit
    meat packing plants are blocked, they talk to both a former food inspector as
    well as an animal rights activist with a nationwide network of whistleblowers
    to get the inside story. Their message? Germany's meat industry is out of control.

  summary: British social psychologist Steve Reicher believes that all social change
    happens through the collective. Human beings all over the planet endured a serious
    infringement of their private rights when governments made the decision to lock
    down amid the COVID-19 crisis. For the most part, there was consensus that this
    tough decision was correct. But how was that consensus established?

  summary: Indian environmental economist Pavan Sukhdev explains in this podcast why
    our interconnectedness with wildlife is central, even though the exact origin

  summary: When Neil and Gabe start exploring why Germany's insect population has

On the Green Fence lives up to its name in looking at complex, often
divisive environmental issues from multiple angles. It’s not about
greenism, but about delving into the major concerns of our time in an
engaging and human way. DW reporter Neil King sits on the fence and
explores the role business, society and science play in our transition
to a more environmentally friendly world. In so doing, he aims to make
sense of issues that affect us all, but which are often over-
simplified or convoluted by ideology and lobbyism. On the Green Fence
stands for an open-minded, relevant and entertaining approach to the
environment.
